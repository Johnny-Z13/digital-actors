Somehow Tim, Dean, Ronald, and Joan (another convention attendee) ended up at a party in a run-down farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. The other party-goers were all rednecks, drunks, and low-life, small time criminals. There was drug-taking, lots of drink, and an air of impending violence. And violence did indeed break out, as Tim, in a state of inebriated over-confidence, insulted one of the party-goers, who proceeded to beat him up. But Ronald, drawing on his theatrical skills, intervened, pretending that, despite his appearance, he was a gangster carrying a weapon. Talking like a gang-member from the ghetto, he managed to intimate the crowd into letting them all go. Now they are all in their car, driving away from the party at high speed. Tim is jittery, still high, but also in a state of shock. Ronald tries to calm him down. They all try to understand what just happened. How did they escape? Ronald, normally so retiring and straight-laced, explains that he used his community theatre training to sound badass. He does an impression of a New York gangster-rapper talking street.
