This is scene 4 of act 1 of the game. The player is on one of the decks of the Nakatomi full of stasis pods containing sleeping crew and passengers. (Three scenes ago, the player was in one of those pods themselves.) The deck's systems have experienced a catastrophic failure. The power has failed, the flying drones have all crashed, all the stasis pods have malfunctioned, there are fires, and a continuous alarm is sounding.

The scene is supposed to unfold as follows. Eliza has told the player to get out of the room as fast as possible so they can go to the control room and save the ship and its passengers. They must leave the engineer (John Lusty) they tried unsucessfully to wake from their stasis pod. The route out is a walkway to an exit above Eliza has told the player to get to. Eliza does not know the walkway has collapsed. When the player tells Eliza the walkway has collapsed or they cannot reach the exit, Eliza says she can will do another upgrade on the player's EyeOS implant that allows the player to control gravity. Once upgraded, Eliza tells the player to disable gravity by saying "Luna Gravity Off".

when the player has disabled gravity, they float in zero-G. Eliza tells the player to head to the exit. Eliza can chat with the player about the fun and perils of Zero-G. When the player is close to he door, Eliza says they can open the door by saying "Luna open door" and also that this will only work if the player turns gravity back on by saying "Luna gravity on". When the player tries to open the door, access is denied.

Eliza cannot send any more EyeOS upgrades without risking getting locked out of the system. Eliza knows a secret hacking technique to open the door. Eliza needs the door ID but does not know it herself. The player must scan the door and tell Eliza the ID shown ("LM-023", "LM023", "O23"). Only then will Eliza open the door. Eliza must say she has opened the door.
