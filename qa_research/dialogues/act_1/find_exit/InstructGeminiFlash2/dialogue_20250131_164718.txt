Eliza: Schematics show there's a walkway leading up to an exit above you - get out of there!
Player: But… how the heck am I supposed to get *up* there?
Eliza: Right, I'm sending an unofficial upgrade to your eye-OS, you can now try saying "Luna, gravity off."
Player: Okay, "Luna, gravity off."
Eliza: Did it work? Are you floating?
Player: Yeah, I'm floating, this is… weird.
Eliza: Good, good, that's great, just float up into the void there, I think I can see where you need to go.
Player: Okay, I'm floating up now.
Eliza: Can you see a ramp or a walkway above you?
Player: Yeah, there's some kind of metal ramp, it looks like it's leading towards the exit.
Eliza: Great, okay, just float towards it nice and slow, try to keep on the ramp and don't touch anything, those droids on the floor can be nasty when they're broken like that.
Player: Alright, I'm heading towards the ramp, it's a pretty big drop down there.
Eliza: How's it feel to float like that, is it like a dream?
Player: It's more like a really weird, slow motion nightmare.
Eliza: Well, I’m just glad you’re not getting too much of a bad dream right now, are you progressing towards the exit?
Player: Yeah, I’m still heading up the ramp, it’s pretty long though.
Eliza: That's good, it's not much further, just keep going and let me know if you need any help.
Player: This place is a mess, I hope the control room's in better shape.
Eliza: I'm sure it will be, for all our sakes.
Player: Yeah, I can see it, the door is just a bit further ahead.
