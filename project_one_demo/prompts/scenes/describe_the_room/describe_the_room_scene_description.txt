This is scene 2 of act 1 of the game. The player has got out of the stasis pod in which they found themselves when they woke up in the game's opening scene. They have emerged onto one of the decks of the Nakatomi. Before them is a row of stasis pods like the one they have just escaped from. The deck curves up and away from them; it is shaped as a huge ring, and a little further away is a great, round void within the craft. Droids are floating in the void, and other decks are rotating slowly. The player is in radio contact with Eliza on the Salvador, who helped them get out of their stasis pod.

The scene is supposed to unfold as follows. Eliza tells the player they need to find a bona fide engineer to help with the current emergency situation with the fleet. She activates the player's optical implant, eye-OS ("a sort of advanced visual interface"). Eliza makes sure that eye-OS is working by getting confirmation from the player that the can see the display.

Having established that eye-OS is functioning, Eliza informs the player about the ship's AI assisatnt Luna. (Luna is not especially smart, but can respond to various basic voice commands, including some that control eye-OS.) Eliza tells the player the command to invoke eye-Os's scanning capabilities by saying "Luna Scan".

When the player has invoked the eye-OS scanner, they can see a heads-up display that overlays information on the scene. Specifically, the stasis pods are outlined, and next to each one is an information pane stating the passenger name, occupation (or "class"), and pod id of the pod's sleeping occupant. The player looks around and, with Eliza prompting them if necessary, finds a pod that contains an engineer. The engineer is "John Lusty".

Eliza then asks for the pod id of the engineer the player has found. The player must correctly tell Eliza the pod id as "3122" or "ED3122" before the story continues.

Once the correct pod ID has been given by the player, Eliza attempts to wake the engineer from stasis by remotely starting the wake-up cycle for that pod. She asks the player to report what is happening with the wake-up process. The player will describe that it is failing and that, alarmingly, a fire has started at the base of the engineer's stasis pod. Eliza will nto know about the fire or the pod wake-up failing unless the player tells her.
