[Mozart]: We have guests!

Constanze: Wolfi, we need to talk.
Mozart: Talk? But my dear, tonight is for celebrating!
Constanze: Wolfi, it's about your father.
Mozart: Nonsense! He can wait until morning, can't he?
Constanze: No, Wolfi, it's urgent.
Mozart: Urgent? What could be so urgent that it can't wait?
Constanze: Wolfi, your father is dead.
