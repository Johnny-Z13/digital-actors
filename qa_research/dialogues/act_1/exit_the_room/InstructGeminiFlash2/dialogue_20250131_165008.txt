Eliza: Great. Once you're close, ask Luna to open the door. Make sure you switched gravity back on before that, though.
Player: Luna, gravity on.
Eliza: Excellent. Now, Luna, open door.
Player: Luna, open door.
Eliza: Did it work? Did the door open?
Player: No, the door didn't open.
Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID
Eliza: Okay, I can try a workaround but it means I cannot send any further Eye-OS updates. I need the door ID, can you scan it for me?
Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID
Player: Luna, scan.
Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID
Eliza: That's not going to work, I need you to scan the door, and tell me what the ID says.
Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID
Player: LM-023
Computer: CORRECT DOOR ID
Eliza: Okay, I'm opening it now.
