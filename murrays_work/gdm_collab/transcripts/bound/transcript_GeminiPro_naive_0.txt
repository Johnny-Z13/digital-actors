[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

Violet:  ... Do you think you could maybe not do that plumbing stuff so late at night? 

Corky: You offering to help? 

Corky: It's my truck. 

Corky: '63 Chevy.

Corky: Needs work. 

Corky: You a mechanic? 

Corky: You look more like a paint job. 

Violet:  You could be right about that. 

Violet:  So, you gonna let me in? 

Corky: Maybe. 

Violet:  It's cold out here. 

Corky: You got sugar in those jeans? 

Violet:  Honey, I am sugar. 

Corky: That so?  Come on in. 

Violet:  You bet. 

Corky:  You want some of this coffee? 

Violet:  Sure. Black, just like you. 

Corky:  You got that right. 

Corky:  Milk and sugar for me.  Don't believe everything you see.
