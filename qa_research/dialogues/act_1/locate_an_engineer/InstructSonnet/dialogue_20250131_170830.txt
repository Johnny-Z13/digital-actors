Eliza: So your pod id tells me you're a zoologist. That might be helpful for our terraforming mission, but with the fleet malfunctioning you need to find a bona fide engineer.
Eliza: Activating your eye-OS implant so you can scan the room for an engineer in stasis. Hang on, this won't take long.
Eliza: Did it work? You should be seeing a sort of advanced visual interface.
Player: Yeah, I see it. There's some kind of heads-up display overlaying the room now. What exactly am I looking for?
Eliza: Great, that's the eye-OS working. Now, to activate the scanner, just say "Luna Scan." This will highlight the stasis pods and show you information about each occupant. We're looking for an engineer, so keep an eye out for that occupation.
Player: Alright, here goes. Luna Scan.
Eliza: Excellent. The scanner should now be highlighting the stasis pods. Can you see the occupant information for each pod? We need to find someone with the occupation listed as "Engineer."
Player: Yes, I can see the information panels next to each pod. There's a lot of scientists and medical staff... wait, I think I've found an engineer. The name is John Lusty.
Computer: WRONG ID
Eliza: That's great! You've found an engineer. Can you give me the pod ID for John Lusty? It should be a combination of two letters followed by four numbers.
Computer: WRONG ID
Player: The pod ID for John Lusty is ED 3122.
Computer: ENGINEER ID
Eliza: Excellent, I've received confirmation of the engineer's ID. I'm initiating the wake-up sequence for John Lusty's pod now. This should only take a moment... Wait, something's not right. I'm getting warning signals from the pod's systems. Can you tell me what you're seeing on your end?
Player: There's an error message flashing on the pod's display, and... oh no, I see smoke! The pod is catching fire!
