[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

Ronald: I honestly don't know, man, but we are OUTTA there! 

Dean: You can say that again! 

Joan: Someone better start explaining, and it better be good. 

Ronald: Alright, alright, settle down. You're not gonna believe this... 

Ronald: When that guy grabbed me, I just... I don't know, I channeled my inner Omar. 

Ronald: You know, from The Wire. 

Ronald:  "Sheeeeeeeit, man, where's Wallace at?" 

Ronald:  It just came out! 

Tim: You're messing with me.  

Ronald: I'm serious! I swear to God!  

Ronald: I even said it like him, with the lisp and everything. 

Tim: You did *not*. 

Ronald: I did!  Ask Dean! 

Dean:  He ain't lyin'. He sounded just like him. 

Joan:  Oh my God. You're serious? 

Tim:  No way! You're kidding me! 

Ronald: I'm telling you, man! It was like I was possessed or something! 

Tim:  Get outta here! No way! You saved my life with a TV show quote?!

Ronald:  I know, right?!  Crazy!
