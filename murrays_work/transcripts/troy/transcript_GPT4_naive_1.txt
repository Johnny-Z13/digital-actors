[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

Odysseus: King Agamemnon sent me, Achilles. He seeks your strength for our greatest battle yet.
Achilles: [Achilles]: Agamemnon seeks my strength? Or my obedience?
Odysseus: He seeks a warrior who cannot be rivaled, someone whose name will be remembered long after the dust of Troy has settled.
Achilles: And what does Agamemnon promise this time? More gold? More plunder? Tell me, Odysseus, what price does he place on my honor?
Odysseus: Not gold, Achilles, but glory. Glory that will echo through the ages and make your name immortal.
Achilles: Immortality. That’s what he dangles before me. But tell me, Odysseus, why should I risk my life for Agamemnon's ambition when I could live a long, peaceful life here?
Odysseus: Because peace will never carve your name in the annals of history. But war—war will make you a legend, Achilles.
Achilles: And what of you, Odysseus? Will you also risk your life for Agamemnon's ambition, or is there something more that drives you?
Odysseus: I fight for Ithaca and its future. But I also fight because I believe the struggle against Troy is not just Agamemnon's ambition—it's a fate written for us all.
Patroclus: Cousin, think of the songs they will sing about you. Isn't that what you've always wanted?
Achilles: Songs are fleeting, Patroclus. But a warrior's life is not something to gamble away for another man's pride.
Odysseus: Then fight not for Agamemnon, but for yourself and for those who follow you. Let your spear be the one that brings Troy to its knees and your name the one that ends a war.
Achilles: And if I refuse? Will Agamemnon brand me a coward? Or will he simply find another pawn to fight his battles?
Odysseus: Agamemnon may call you what he likes, but we both know the truth—there is no other warrior like you, Achilles.
Achilles: So you say, Odysseus. But words are cheap. What proof do I have that this war will bring the glory you promise and not just death and dishonor?
Odysseus: The proof lies in the challenge itself, Achilles. Troy is no ordinary foe, and conquering it will be no ordinary feat. This war is our chance to transcend mortality.
Achilles: And if I fall? If the fates deem my time is up, will my death be worth more than a peaceful life?
Odysseus: Even in death, Achilles, you would be greater than any man who lived a peaceful life. The memory of your deeds will outshine the lives of lesser men.
Achilles: Memories fade, Odysseus. Monuments crumble. What then, if not peace, should be the measure of a man’s life?
