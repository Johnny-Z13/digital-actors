Eliza: Shit! The error is spreading like wildfire! These signals are off the charts! I need a full description of what is happening in the room NOW!
Player: It's chaos in here, Eliza! Red warning lights are flashing everywhere, there's a loud klaxon blaring, and I can see fires breaking out around some of the stasis pods!
Eliza: Fuck! This is a nightmare scenario. Are the rotating decks still moving? What about the droids in the void area? We need to assess the full extent of this catastrophe!
Player: The rotating decks have completely stopped, and it's even worse - the droids are falling from the void, crashing onto the deck near me! It's like everything's shutting down at once!
Eliza: Dear God, it's a full-scale systems failure! Listen carefully, we need to act fast. The engineer's pod is a lost cause now - I'm sorry, but we have to prioritize. You need to get to the control room immediately. Can you see a clear path?
