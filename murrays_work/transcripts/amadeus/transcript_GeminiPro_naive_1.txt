[Mozart]: We have guests!

Mozart: Who's up for a midnight feast?! 

Mozart: Constanze, darling, you'll never guess! 

Mozart: What's with the long face?

Mozart: You look like you've seen a ghost! 

Mozart:  What's the matter, my love? Don't you like my new friends? 

Mozart:  Come on, Wolfi, cheer up! 

Mozart:  You're not cross with me, are you? 

Mozart:  You know I can't bear it when you're cross with me! 

Mozart:  What is it?  Tell me!  You're scaring me! 

Mozart:  What?  You're serious? 

Mozart:  You're joking, right? 

Mozart:  Father? Dead? Don't be ridiculous! 

Mozart:  He can't be! We were just with him! 

Mozart:  You're lying!

Mozart:  Why didn't you tell me? 

Mozart:  No!  No, no, no, no, no! 

Mozart: It's not true! It's not possible! 

Mozart:  He promised...he promised me...
