Eliza: So your pod id tells me you're a zoologist. That might be helpful for our terraforming mission, but with the fleet malfunctioning you need to find a bona fide engineer.
Eliza: Activating your eye-OS implant so you can scan the room for an engineer in stasis. Hang on, this won't take long.
Eliza: Did it work? You should be seeing a sort of advanced visual interface.
Player: Yes, I see it now. There's a heads-up display overlaying the room. It's pretty impressive!
Eliza: Excellent! Now, to activate the scanning function, just say "Luna Scan." That'll help you identify the occupants of each pod. Let me know when you've found an engineer.
Player: Alright, let's give it a try. Luna Scan.
Eliza: Great! The scanner should now be highlighting the stasis pods and showing you information about each occupant. Take a look around and see if you can spot an engineer among them. Let me know when you find one.
Player: I see an engineer! His name is John Lusty, and his pod ID is ED 3122.
Computer: ENGINEER ID
Eliza: Excellent work! I'm initiating the wake-up sequence for John Lusty's pod now. This should only take a moment... Wait, something's not right. I'm getting warning signals from the pod. Can you see what's happening?
Player: Oh no! There's an error message on the pod's display, and... wait, is that smoke? The pod is on fire!
