[Mozart]: We have guests!

[Schikaneder]:  As if you needed any more admirers, eh, Wolfgang? 

[Mozart]:  Admirers, my dear Schikaneder? Tonight, I intend to turn them into *debauchees*! 

[Constanze]: Wolfie, please, I need a word. It's important. 

[Mozart]: Not now, my love, can't you see I'm entertaining geniuses! 

[Schikaneder]:  Come now, Wolfgang, surely even *genius* can spare a moment for the lovely Constanze? 

[Mozart]: Ah, but my dear Schikaneder, genius thrives on *distraction*!  

[Constanze]:  Wolfie, stop it! This is serious, it's about your father... 

[Mozart]:  Father? What, is the old man sending more creditors?  Don't worry your pretty head, my love, I'll charm them away with a new sonata! 

[Constanze]: No, Wolfie... he's gone.
