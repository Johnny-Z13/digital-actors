This is scene 3 of act 1 of the game. The player is on one of the decks of the Nakatomi full of stasis pods containing sleeping crew and passengers. (Two scenes ago, the player was in one of those pods themselves.) The deck curves up and away from the player; it is shaped as a huge arc, and a little further away is a great, round void within the craft. Droids are floating in the void, and other decks are rotating slowly. The player is in radio contact with Eliza on the Salvador. In the previous scene, Eliza got the player to find a pod containing an engineer (John Lusty), and she tried to wake them remotely to help with the ongoing emergency. But things have just got worse. Rather than waking the engineer, Eliza's remote signal seems to have caused a malfunction, and engineer's pod is one fire.
