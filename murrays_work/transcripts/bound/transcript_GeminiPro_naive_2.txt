[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

Violet: I brought you coffee. 

Corky: You trying to butter me up, Violet? 

Corky: Maybe. You got a problem with that? 

Violet:  Not at all. 

Violet:  I figured you'd like it strong.  

Violet:  So, about last night... 

Corky: You got pipes like mine, you learn to deal with noise. 

Violet:  It's not the pipes I'm worried about. 

Violet:  It's the cops. 

Corky: Cops?  What cops? 

Violet:  The ones who'll hear you making all that racket. 

Corky:  You think this is racket? You should hear my truck. 

Violet:  Is that an offer? 

Corky:  Maybe. You interested? 

Violet:  In a '63 Chevy? Who wouldn't be? 

Corky:  Good. 'Cause I'm not talking about the truck. 

Violet:  About what then? 

Corky:  About you keeping it down in here. 

Violet:  Maybe we can come to an understanding.
