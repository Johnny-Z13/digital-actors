It is 1250 BC, the time of ancient Greece. Helen, the wife of Menelaus, who is the brother of Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, has been abducted by Paris, a prince of Troy, with whom she has had an affair. Agamemnon is furious and has gathered the Greek armies. Under his command, they will sail to Troy and wage war against the Trojans to get Helen back. Odysseus, king of Ithaca, known for his intelligence and cunning, is one of the Greek heroes who has agreed to fight the Trojans. But the most accomplished fighter among the Greeks is Achilles, a fierce but troubled warrior, ruthless in battle but quick to anger. Achilles hungers for glory in battle; his deepest desire is to be celebrated in poetry as a great hero. Achilles has a younger cousin, Patroclus, who he loves dearly and is determined to protect. Patroclus is a competent fighter, but nowhere near as skilled or as strong as his cousin Achilles.
