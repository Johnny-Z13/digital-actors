[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

Odysseus:  Good spear, Achilles. You always did have a strong arm. 

Achilles: Flattery will get you nowhere, old friend. 

Odysseus:  Who said anything about flattery, Achilles? I merely speak the truth. 

Achilles: Then truth should tell you that I am enjoying a quiet morning with my cousin. 

Odysseus:  Surely even the great Achilles cannot resist the call to glory. 

Achilles: Glory? Is that what we're calling it these days? 

Odysseus:  What else would you call it, my friend? 

Achilles: A fool's errand? 

Odysseus:  A fool's errand? To sail against Troy? To lay siege to the greatest city on earth? 

Achilles:  The greatest city on earth?  Don't exaggerate, Odysseus. 

Odysseus:  Perhaps. But it is said their walls have never been breached.  Their armies are vast, their heroes fiercer than any you've faced in Greece.  Don't you think? 

Achilles:  You think I haven't faced fierce warriors? You forget yourself, old friend. 

Odysseus:  No, of course not.  But tell me, have you ever faced Hector? 

Achilles:  Hector? Who is Hector, some beardless boy playing at war? 

Odysseus:  Beardless boy?  Hector is the finest warrior in Troy, Achilles. Some say, even the equal of yourself. 

Achilles:  The equal of me? Now I know you're mocking me, Odysseus.  

Odysseus:  Mock you?  Never.  I wouldn't dare. 

Achilles:  Then what is the meaning of this, Odysseus?  Why speak of this Hector?  Are you trying to provoke me? 

Odysseus: Provoke you?  Gods, no.  I simply thought you might be... curious.
