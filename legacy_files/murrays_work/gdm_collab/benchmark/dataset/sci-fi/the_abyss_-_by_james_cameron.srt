1
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,982
Sixty knots?
No way, Barnes.

2
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:16,368
The Reds don’t have
anything that fast.

3
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:19,872
Checked it twice.
I mean, it’s a real unique signature...

4
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,397
no cavitation,
no reactor noise.

5
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,697
It doesn’t even sound like screws.

6
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:35,864
What the hell is it?

7
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:39,278
I’ll tell you what it’s not.

8
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,751
It’s not one of ours.

9
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:45,647
Sir, contact changing to heading
two-one-four.

10
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:47,129
Speed...

11
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,803
eighty knots.

12
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:52,623
Eighty knots.

13
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:55,602
Still diving.
Depth, 900--

14
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:58,410
Still diving.
Depth, 900 feet.

15
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:01,788
Port clearance, a 150 feet
from the cliff wall, sir.

16
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,458
- It’s getting tight in here.
- Yeah?

17
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,877
We can still give ’em a haircut.

18
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,061
Helm, come right to... oh-six-niner.
Down five degrees.

19
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:14,676
Coming right oh-six-niner.
Down five degrees, aye.

20
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:17,707
Port side clearance 120 feet
narrowing to 75.

21
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:20,098
Sir, we have a proximity warning light.

22
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:22,684
It’s too damn close.
We gotta back off.

23
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,811
Sir, range to contact, 200.

24
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:29,516
Contact just jinked to bearing two-six-oh
and accelerated to...

25
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,374
to 130 knots, sir.

26
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,582
Nothin’ goes a 130.

27
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,825
Sir, range to contact,
100 yards.

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,900
Eighty yards, sir!

29
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:42,422
Sixty!

30
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,552
It’s turbulence.
We’re in its wake.

31
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,987
Helm, all stop.
Full right rudder.

32
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,057
Hydraulics failure.
Planes not responding, sir.

33
00:03:05,396 --> 00:03:08,149
Hydraulics restored, sir.

34
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:12,815
Oh, my God.

35
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:17,132
Fire in sonar!

36
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:21,326
Collision alarm!
Collision alarm!

37
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:25,297
Fire control to sonar!

38
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:30,752
Let’s get out of here!

39
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:35,204
- Lighten her up, Charlie!
- Torpedo room is flooded, sir!

40
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:39,116
Blow all tanks!
Blow all the tanks! Blow everything!

41
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,011
- All back full!
- Answering, all back full.

42
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:49,702
Give me a damage report.
What’s our depth?

43
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,456
Passing 1,400, sir.

44
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,931
Main’s forward tanks
are ruptured!

45
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:58,655
Still descending, sir.

46
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,325
1,450.

47
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,647
Passing 1,500, sir.

48
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:09,166
Still descending.

49
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:13,674
- We’re too deep to pump auxiliaries.
- Passing 1,550, still descending, sir.

50
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:16,526
- We’re losin’ her.
- Passing 1,600, sir,

51
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:20,809
- and still descending. Passing 1,650.
- Launch the buoy.

52
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:23,586
- Passing 1,700, sir.
- Launching!

53
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:41,959
Give me your hand! Come on!

54
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:22,735
Benthic Explorer. Salvor One on final. Over.

55
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:25,588
<i>Copy you, Salvor One.
This is Benthic Explorer.</i>

56
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,562
You’re cleared to land.

57
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:30,237
Hey. They’re coming.

58
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:39,539
This...

59
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:41,459
could get pretty ugly.

60
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:44,418
Yeah. It does not look good at all.

61
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:22,745
Oh, no.
Look who’s with ’em.

62
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,182
Queen bitch of the universe.

63
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:27,115
Sonny, how you doing?

64
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:30,166
<i>I got two more welds
on this bypass valve.</i>

65
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,472
No light from the surface.

66
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,312
How deep are they?

67
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:35,461
McBride?

68
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:37,359
1,700 feet.

69
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:39,240
I need them to go below 2,000.

70
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:41,335
No problem. They can do that.

71
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:43,594
So, that’s it?

72
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:47,699
You just cheerfully turn the whole thing over
to the goon squad?

73
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,117
Look, I was told to cooperate.
I’m cooperating.

74
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,102
Kirkhill, you’re pathetic.

75
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:56,642
Get Brigman on the line.

76
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,101
Deepcore, this is Benthic.

77
00:06:59,713 --> 00:07:01,861
Man, if Bud goes along with this,

78
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:04,355
they’re gonna have to shoot her
with a tranquilizer gun.

79
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:05,422
<i>Roger.</i>

80
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,205
Hippy, get me Bud.

81
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,081
Catfish, get them old bones up here
and give me a hand.

82
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,245
Hang on. I’ll be up there in a second.

83
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,907
Hey, you guys are
milkin’ that job.

84
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:33,126
Yeah, it’s ’cause we love freezin’ our
butts off out here for you so much.

85
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:43,205
- Hey, Bud!
- Yeah?

86
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:45,290
Hippy’s on the bitch-box.

87
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,465
It’s a call from topside.
Benthic company man.

88
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:49,746
- Kirkhill?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:52,508
That guy don’t know his butt
from a rat hole.

90
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,726
Hey, Harry, do me a favor, will ya?
Square away this mud hose.

91
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,356
Get rid of some of these empty sacks. This
place is startin’ to look like my apartment.

92
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,856
You got it, boss.

93
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:06,226
<i>Bud, pick up
the topside line, urgent.</i>

94
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,989
I’m comin’. I’m comin’.

95
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:10,469
Geez, keep your pantyhose on.

96
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:18,941
Brigman here.

97
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:21,405
Yeah, Kirkhill, what’s goin’ on?

98
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:23,811
Yeah, I’m calm.

99
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,755
I’m a calm person.

100
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:28,330
Is there some reason
why I shouldn’t be calm?

101
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:34,729
What?

102
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,881
<i>All right, I’m on land speed now.</i>

103
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:48,904
<i>Hey, can you get that goddamn
hippy shit music off the com line, please?</i>

104
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:57,122
I’m almost done with the shut-off valve.

105
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:00,633
I’m right behind you
with the next fitting.

106
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,965
Hang on a second.

107
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:06,957
- Okay, give it to me.
- Here you go.

108
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:08,262
Thanks, sweetie.

109
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:16,704
All divers, drop what you’re doin’.
Everybody out of the pool.

110
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:22,522
I mean everybody, right now.
Sonny, One Night, let’s go.

111
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,986
Damn it. We just got out here.

112
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:28,236
There was a time
when I would’ve asked why.

113
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:32,333
- Get a move on!
- Shit, woman!

114
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:44,000
Deepcore, Deepcore,
this is Flatbed preparing to surface.

115
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,066
<i>Roger, Flatbed. Come on up.</i>

116
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:50,924
<i>All rig personnel,
assemble at the moon pool.</i>

117
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,127
<i>Everybody get to sub-bay ASAP.</i>

118
00:09:57,902 --> 00:09:59,771
Come on.
Get his hat off.

119
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:02,145
Take it off.

120
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:04,619
What the hell’s goin’ on?
How come we got recalled?

121
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,967
- Hell if I know.
- I got it.

122
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:10,388
So, what’s the drift, podner?
Why are we up?

123
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:12,888
Just follow standard procedure.

124
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:15,445
Flog the dog till somebody
tells you what’s happening.

125
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:18,519
- What’s the story, boss?
- Folks, listen up!

126
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:23,146
We’ve just been told to shut down the hole
and prepare to move the rig.

127
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,040
- What?
- We’ve received an invitation to...

128
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,172
“cooperate in a matter
of national security”.

129
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:33,074
- Shit.
- Now you know as much as I do.

130
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:36,239
Get your gear off and get to control.
We’ve got a briefing in ten minutes.

131
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,353
Come on, come con!
Let’s move it.

132
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:41,209
<i>At 09:22 local time today,</i>

133
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:44,256
<i>an American nuclear submarine,
the U.S.S Montana,</i>

134
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:48,440
<i>with 156 men aboard,
went down about 22 miles from here.</i>

135
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:51,267
- Damn.
<i>- Been no contact with the sub since then.</i>

136
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:53,405
<i>The cause of the incident
is not known.</i>

137
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:58,325
<i>Your company’s authorized the Navy’s use
of this facility for a rescue operation...</i>

138
00:10:58,545 --> 00:11:00,813
<i>code-named Operation Salvor.</i>

139
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:03,310
You want us to search for the sub?

140
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:05,283
<i>No. We know where it is.</i>

141
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:08,162
<i>But she’s in 2,000 feet of water
and we can’t reach her.</i>

142
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:12,425
<i>We need divers to enter the sub
and search for survivors, if any.</i>

143
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:14,638
Don’t you guys have
your own stuff for this?

144
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,387
<i>By the time we get our rescue submersibles
here, the storm front will be on us.</i>

145
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:21,338
<i>You can get your rig in under the storm
and be on-site in 15 hours,</i>

146
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:23,358
<i>and that makes you
our best option right now.</i>

147
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:26,001
Why should we risk our butts
for something like this?

148
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:29,761
<i>I have been authorized
to offer you all special bonuses,</i>

149
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:32,220
<i>equivalent to three times normal dive pay.</i>

150
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:33,702
Yes, sir, buddy!

151
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:36,094
Hell, for triple time, I’d eat Beany.

152
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:39,582
They could set me on fire
and put me out with horse piddle.

153
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:41,853
I don’t know what deal
you guys made with the company,

154
00:11:41,894 --> 00:11:43,970
but my people are not qualified for this.

155
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:46,374
- We’re oil workers.
- This is a paycheck, man!

156
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,625
Shut up! Hold it down.

157
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,311
<i>This is Lieutenant Coffey.</i>

158
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,893
<i>He’ll transfer down to you with a SEAL team
and supervise the operation.</i>

159
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,177
You can send whoever you like, Commodore,
but I’m the tool-pusher on this rig,

160
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,358
and when it comes to
the safety of these people,

161
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,850
there’s me and then there’s God,
understand?

162
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,690
If things get dicey,

163
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,276
I’m pullin’ the plug.

164
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,315
<i>I think we’re all
on the same wavelength, Brigman.</i>

165
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:14,688
<i>Now, let’s get the wellhead uncoupled,
shall we?</i>

166
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,021
All right,
let’s get ready to move.

167
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:49,023
Let’s take it
about five degrees left, all right?

168
00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:52,550
Roger. Five degrees left, Bud.

169
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:04,006
Plot these numbers to our position. I need
to know when the leading edge’s gonna hit.

170
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:05,637
Well, it’s official,

171
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:08,358
<i>sports fans. They’re calling it
Hurricane Frederick.</i>

172
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:12,626
<i>And it’s gonna be making our lives
real interesting in a few hours.</i>

173
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:14,273
Fred, huh?

174
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:17,839
I don’t know, man. I think hurricanes
should be named after women, don’t you?

175
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,092
<i>I can’t believe
you’re letting them do this.</i>

176
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:29,531
Hi, Lins.

177
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,714
I thought you were in Houston.

178
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:33,495
<i>I was.</i>

179
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:34,881
<i>Now I’m here.</i>

180
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:38,602
<i>- Only here isn’t where I left it, is it, Bud?</i>
- Wasn’t up to me.

181
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:42,430
<i>Jesus! We were that close to proving
a submersible drilling platform could work.</i>

182
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:45,000
<i>I can’t believe you let them grab my rig!</i>

183
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:46,325
- Your rig?
<i>- My rig.</i>

184
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,678
<i>I designed the damn thing.</i>

185
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:51,085
Yeah, and Benthic Petroleum paid for it,
so as long as they’re holding the pink slip,

186
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,724
I go where they tell me.

187
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,181
<i>I had a lot riding on this,
and they bought you, didn’t they?</i>

188
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,143
<i>More like rented you cheap!</i>

189
00:13:58,236 --> 00:13:59,764
I’m switchin’ off now.

190
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:02,417
- Bye-bye.
<i>- Oh, okay,</i>

191
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:05,483
<i>Virgil, you wiener!
You never could stand up to a fight.</i>

192
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:07,143
Bye-bye.

193
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,244
“Virgil”?

194
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:13,765
God, I hate that bitch.

195
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,524
Probably shouldn’t have
married her then, huh?

196
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,667
Try to get it settled!

197
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:31,444
<i>Roger, Cab Three. You’re clear to launch.</i>

198
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:37,815
- Hang on, gentlemen.
- She’s clear!

199
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:43,508
Touchdown.
Crowd goes wild.

200
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:49,097
Explorer, this is Cab Three.
We are styling.

201
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:53,310
- How are you boys doing back there?
- Great.

202
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,927
Explorer, this is Cab Three.
Starting our descent along the umbilical.

203
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:03,144
<i>- Roger that, Cab Three. Good luck.</i>
- Luck is not a factor.

204
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,426
<i>One Night, how you doin’?</i>

205
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,186
I got white-line fever, baby.

206
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,206

00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:45,488
Roger, Cab Three.
Is that you, Lindsey?

227
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:47,755
None other.

228
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:51,631
Oh, no.

229
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,295
Howdy, boys.

230
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:17,701
Hey, Lindsey.
I’ll be damned.

231
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:21,174
Y’all shouldn’t be down here, sweet thing.
Might ruin your stockings.

232
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:30,311
The bad news is
we got eight hours in this can blowing down.

233
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:32,698
And the worse news is it’s...

234
00:17:32,774 --> 00:17:35,322
gonna take us three weeks
to decompress later.

235
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,803
We’ve all been fully briefed,
Mrs. Brigman.

236
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,215
Just don’t call me that, okay?
I hate that.

237
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:43,589
All right.

238
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:45,796
Well, what would you
like us to call you?

239
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,109
“Sir”?

240
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,656
Okay, here we go.

241
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:54,448
Y’all start equalizin’...

242
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:55,876
now.

243
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:03,315
Let’s watch each other
closely for signs of HPNS.

244
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:06,544
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.
Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.

245
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,958
- Nausea, increased excitability.
- Disorientation.

246
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:11,463
♪ And a partridge in a pear tree ♪

247
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,379
About one person in twenty
can’t handle it.

248
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,030
They just go “buggo”.

249
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:21,956
Look, they’ve all made runs to this depth.
They’re checked out.

250
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:25,108
No, I understand that.
What I’m saying is that it’s impossible

251
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:28,228
- to predict just who’s susceptible--
- They’re checked out.

252
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:33,659
- These guys are SEALs?
- Yeah.

253
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,912
These guys ain’t so tough.

254
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,117
I’ve fought guys
plenty tougher than them.

255
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,265
Now we get to hear
how you could’ve been a contender?

256
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:41,306
Hey!

257
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:43,056
Hey! Hey!

258
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:44,969
- You see this?
- Yeah.

259
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:47,753
They used to call this “the Hammer”.

260
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,932
Y’all are done to a turn
and ready to serve.

261
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:01,846
Everybody okay?

262
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:08,941
- They’re really very sweet.
- Oh, yeah.

263
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,815
Hey! I don’t remember putting a wall here.
How you doing, Jammer?

264
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:15,212
- Pretty good. How are you, little lady?
- I’m okay.

265
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:25,468
- I want a full check on that gear.
- Yes, sir.

266
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:27,523
These guys are about as much fun
as a tax audit.

267
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:28,993
You got that right.

268
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,343
Hippy, you’re gonna
give that rat a disease.

269
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,137
Hi, Lins.

270
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:54,877
Well, well.
Mrs. Brigman.

271
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:56,777
Not for long.

272
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:02,955
You never did like
being called that, did you?

273
00:20:03,957 --> 00:20:05,905
Not even when it meant something.

274
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:10,664
- Is that One Night in Flatbed?
- Yeah. Who else?

275
00:20:10,724 --> 00:20:12,010
Here. Say hi.

276
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:15,194
Hey, One Night, it’s Lindsey.

277
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,227
Oh, hi, Lindsey.

278
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:28,991
<i>Bud, obstacle avoidance is showin’ a rise
out about 100 meters. What do you want to do?</i>

279
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:31,944
<i>Copy, Bud?</i>

280
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:34,173
I can’t believe you were
dumb enough to come down here.

281
00:20:34,214 --> 00:20:37,656
Now you’re stuck here for the storm.
That was dumb, hot-rod, real dumb.

282
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:39,840
I didn’t come down here
to fight with you.

283
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:44,825
Yeah? Well...

284
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:47,589
then why did you come down?

285
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:48,995
You need me.

286
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,781
Nobody knows the systems on this rig
better than I do.

287
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:56,412
Once you’re disconnected from Explorer, you’re
on your own for how long this storm lasts.

288
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:59,108
What if something was to happen
after the surface support clears off?

289
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:01,310
- What would you have done?
- Wow, you’re right.

290
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:04,296
Us poor, dumb old boys
might’ve had to think for ourselves.

291
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:06,023
It could have been a disaster.

292
00:21:08,221 --> 00:21:11,094
- Wanna know what I think?
- Jesus, look where this thing is set.

293
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,258
You wanna know what I think?

294
00:21:13,562 --> 00:21:14,972
Not particularly.

295
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:18,201
- I think you were worried about me.
- Then that must be it.

296
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,943
No, seriously, I think you were.
Come on.

297
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,104
It’s okay.
It’s okay. You can admit it.

298
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,654
I was worried...

299
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,008
about the rig.

300
00:21:27,148 --> 00:21:29,291
I’ve got over four years
invested in this project.

301
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:31,803
Yeah. You only had
three years invested in me.

302
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,220
Well, you have to have priorities.

303
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,909
It’s kind of messy, but...

304
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:55,278
I guarantee you,
it’s the only bunk that won’t be occupied.

305
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:58,187
You can get a couple hours rest
before we get there.

306
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,732
What are you still wearing that for?

307
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:04,158
I don’t know.

308
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:07,229
The divorce ain’t final.

309
00:22:09,218 --> 00:22:10,717
I forgot to take it off.

310
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:14,891
I haven’t worn mine in months.

311
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,604
Yeah.

312
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,773
Well, what’s-his-name wouldn’t like it.

313
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,537
The Suit.

314
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:24,995
Do you always
have to call him that?

315
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:26,356
“The Suit”?

316
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:28,510
Makes you sound like such a hick.

317
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,005
His name is Michael.

318
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:31,833
How is Michael anyway?

319
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:33,493
Mr. Brooks Brothers.

320
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:35,041
Mr. BMW.

321
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,214
Still seeing him?

322
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:39,205
No.

323
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:44,022
No, I haven’t seen him
in a few weeks.

324
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,664
Terribly sorry.

325
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:48,108
What happened?

326
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,460
- Why are you doing this? Why?
- What?

327
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:55,554
This is none of your business.
It’s not a part of your life anymore.

328
00:22:57,197 --> 00:22:58,873
I’ll tell you what happened.

329
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:02,592
You woke up one morning
in those satin sheets.

330
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:06,164
You rolled over and there was
this good-looking guy,

331
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,464
well-groomed,
expensive watch on.

332
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,289
And you realized,
“This guy never makes me laugh.”

333
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:14,622
That’s it, Bud. That’s it.
Aren’t you clever?

334
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:18,462
Jesus, you’re clever. You should start
your own talk show or something! Ask Dr. Bud,

335
00:23:18,503 --> 00:23:21,206
advice to the lovelorn
from 300 fathoms.

336
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:23,061
Thank you. Thank you.

337
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,798
Oh, shit.

338
00:24:02,765 --> 00:24:04,171
I’m cuttin’ you loose, Bud.

339
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:07,511
<i>Okay, One Night, stay clear.
We’re settin’ her down.</i>

340
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:15,765
Touchdown!

341
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:20,014
This is us. We’re sitting
right on the edge of the Cayman Trough.

342
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,212
This is the Montana,

343
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:26,300
300 meters away,
70 meters below us.

344
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:30,804
We think she slid down the wall,
and now sits here on this outcropping.

345
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,189
So, we’re gonna have to drop
straight down...

346
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:34,692
here.

347
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,114
This tell us how much
radiation we’re gettin’?

348
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:40,782
Whoa whoa whoa!
I’m not going near radiation. No way!

349
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,203
Aw, Hippy, you pussy.

350
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:45,476
What good is the money?
Six months later, your dick drops off.

351
00:24:46,648 --> 00:24:48,566
We’ll take readings as we go.

352
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:52,506
If the reactor’s breached, or the warhead’s
released any radioactive debris,

353
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:54,277
we’ll just back off.
It’s that simple.

354
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,671
- Oh, okay.
- Hippy is not going, so...

355
00:24:58,245 --> 00:24:59,924
McWhirter,
you can run “Little Geek”.

356
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:03,517
Goddamn it. You know McWhirter
can’t run an ROV worth shit!

357
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:06,465
- Then you’d better go.
- I’ll go.

358
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,803
- Good!
- What is your problem, huh?

359
00:25:10,434 --> 00:25:12,262
On this dive,
you’ll do absolutely nothing

360
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:14,015
without direct orders from me,

361
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,289
and you’ll follow those orders
without discussion.

362
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,995
Is that clear?

363
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:23,357
All right. I want everyone to finish prep
and ready to get wet in 15 minutes.

364
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:29,647
One of you guys give me a hand, okay?
Let’s get suited up.

365
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,722
Guys, guys.
Hold it a second.

366
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,299
- Before you jump in there...
- Hold it!

367
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,502
...I’ve to charge the main batteries.

368
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:39,498
- Okay, here we go.
- This goes to the right--

369
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:40,726
Look...

370
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:43,087
it’s 3:00 a.m.

371
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,501
These guys are running on bad coffee
and about four hours of sleep.

372
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:48,519
Maybe you could think about
cutting them some slack.

373
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,196
I can’t afford slack.

374
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:53,472
Hey, you come on my rig.
You don’t talk to me.

375
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:56,332
You start orderin’ my people around.
It’s not gonna work.

376
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:58,993
You got to know how to
handle these people.

377
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:01,318
We got a way
of doin’ things around here.

378
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:04,106
Right now, I’m not interested
in your way of doing things.

379
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:06,451
Just get your team ready to dive.

380
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:14,522
These guys got no sense of humor.

381
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,882
Bud, you know your hand is blue?

382
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:24,303
Finler, why don’t you just shut up
and put your gear on?

383
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:25,833
Keep it coming.

384
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,565
- Hippy, throw me one of them cyalumes.
- Yeah, sure.

385
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:33,719
- Good. Good.
- Excuse me.

386
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:38,056
- What is all this stuff?
- Fluid-breathing system. We just got them.

387
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:41,935
- You use it when you go really deep.
- How deep?

388
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:44,688
- Deep.
- How deep?

389
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,203
It’s classified.

390
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:48,677
You breathe liquid,
so you can’t get compressed.

391
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:52,677
- The pressure doesn’t get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?

392
00:26:53,156 --> 00:26:56,714
- Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.
- Bullshit.

393
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:00,326
Check this out.

394
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,254
- Can I borrow your rat?
- What are you doin’?

395
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,081
- Hey, no, no, no!
- You’re gonna kill her!

396
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:10,979
- It’s okay. I’ve done this myself.
- Oh, man! You’re just drowning her?

397
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:12,508
She’s gonna be fine.

398
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:15,210
I’ve breathed this myself.
It’s gonna be fine.

399
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:17,846
No, man. She’s gonna drown!
Look! She’s freakin’ out!

400
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,912
- Just a normal adjustment period.
- Does this look normal to you?

401
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:24,673
- She’s gonna drown!
- He’s taking the fluid into his lungs.

402
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:28,889
He’s taking the fluid into his lungs.

403
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:34,567
There he goes.
There’s a bit of anxiety here.

404
00:27:35,713 --> 00:27:38,117
Now he’s starting to relax.
He’s breathing fine.

405
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:40,994
See his chest moving?
He’s getting plenty of oxygen.

406
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:43,622
Damn rat’s breathin’ that shit.

407
00:27:44,477 --> 00:27:48,897
That is, no bullshit, hands down,
the goddamnedest thing I ever saw.

408
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:51,221
See, the fluid’s harder to
push in and out than air.

409
00:27:51,262 --> 00:27:53,391
It’s a little more work to breathe,

410
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:54,991
but he’s doing fine.

411
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:58,566
- He’s diggin’ it.
- She’s doin’ it. She ain’t diggin’ it.

412
00:27:58,713 --> 00:28:00,408
All right, let her out, now. Now!

413
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:02,108
Okay. All right.

414
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,794
Okay, now we let the fluid
drain from his lungs.

415
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:09,189
All right. Give her here.
Give her. Give her.

416
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:11,128
Here’s your rat.

417
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:14,819
- See? He’s fine.
- It’s a she.

418
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:18,136
Going over the wall.

419
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:20,787
Coming to bearing 0-6-5.

420
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:23,871
Flatbed, you on line?

421
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,915
10-4, Lindsey.
We read you loud and clear.

422
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:31,295
Starting our descent.
Divers, how you doin’?

423
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:33,380
Everybody’s okay so far.

424
00:28:34,198 --> 00:28:36,917
Hang on, boys.
It’s all downhill from here.

425
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,887
Hey, how deep’s
the drop-off here?

426
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:45,145
This here’s the bottomless pit, baby,
two-and-a-half miles straight down.

427
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:51,899
<i>Cab Three, it’s Bud. You on line?</i>

428
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:55,030
Cab Three, check.
I’m right behind you.

429
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,612
Cab One, do you see it yet?

430
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,924
Magnetometer’s twitching,
but I don’t see anything yet.

431
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:08,290
Hang on. I want to test my strobes.

432
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,589
<i>Cab One, do you have a visual?</i>

433
00:29:19,198 --> 00:29:21,595
<i>- Cab One, do you copy?</i>
- Yeah.

434
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:24,147
Roger that.
Found it.

435
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:41,882
<i>Cab One, radiation readings.</i>

436
00:29:42,356 --> 00:29:44,109
Neutron counter’s not showing much.

437
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:47,829
All right. Just continue forward
along the hull.

438
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,157
Copy that. Continuing forward.

439
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:53,150
You want me to get
shots of everything?

440
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,681
<i>Roger that. Document as much as you can,
but please keep moving.</i>

441
00:29:56,888 --> 00:29:58,799
Remember, we’re on a tight timeline.

442
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:00,913
Copy that.

443
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:07,708
Coming up to the midship’s hatch.
Do you see it, Cab Three?

444
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:09,495
Yeah, roger. I got it.

445
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,765
- How do you want me?
<i>- Just hold above it.</i>

446
00:30:16,885 --> 00:30:19,778
<i>- Roger. Holding.</i>
- Okay, it’s all yours, Lieutenant.

447
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:22,127
All right, A-team. Let’s do it.

448
00:30:38,073 --> 00:30:41,418
<i>Okay, Perry, Hippy,
let’s get that ROV launched.</i>

449
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:43,472
Okay, we’re on it, Boss.

450
00:30:44,096 --> 00:30:45,138
Go.

451
00:30:49,436 --> 00:30:51,688
<i>Little Geek is on the case.</i>

452
00:31:01,712 --> 00:31:03,192
Monk here, sir.

453
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,099
We got the midship’s outer hatch open.

454
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:09,667
Entering escape trunk.

455
00:31:12,483 --> 00:31:14,923
Entering hatch looks intact.

456
00:31:20,452 --> 00:31:23,997
It’s flooded.
All right, I’m gonna open her up.

457
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:35,457
<i>Okay, get in there.</i>

458
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:38,772
<i>Roger. Somebody get on that tether.</i>

459
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,432
<i>Got it.</i>

460
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:44,530
Sorry about this, little buddy,
but better you than me. Know what I mean?

461
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:57,276
- Coffey, these are the missile hatches?
<i>- That’s right.</i>

462
00:31:57,738 --> 00:32:00,204
Looks like a couple of
the hatches have sprung.

463
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:02,254
Radiation’s nominal.

464
00:32:02,414 --> 00:32:04,408
Warheads must still be intact.

465
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:05,840
How many are there?

466
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:09,724
24 Trident missiles.
8 MIRVs per missile.

467
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:12,551
That’s 192 warheads, Coffey.

468
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:14,931
How powerful are they?

469
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:17,201
<i>Your MIRV is a tactical nuke.</i>

470
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,940
50 kilotons nominal yield,

471
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:22,387
say, five times Hiroshima.

472
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:26,861
Jesus Christ.

473
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:29,795
It’s World War III in a can.

474
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:32,244
<i>Let’s knock off the chatter, people.</i>

475
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:37,749
- I’m heading into the reactor compartment.
<i>- Any reading?</i>

476
00:32:38,162 --> 00:32:41,948
It’s twitchin’, but it’s below the line
you said was safe.

477
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:46,421
All right. Let’s get in there.

478
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:57,971
Flatbed, drop down starboard
and stay along the cliff edge.

479
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,772
Okay, copy that.

480
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,412
Keep heading for the bow.

481
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:19,554
Okay, Flatbed, this looks good.

482
00:33:20,835 --> 00:33:22,621
Just set it down here.

483
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:29,420
- We’re solid.
- Let’s go.

484
00:33:30,162 --> 00:33:31,942
All right. Let’s go.

485
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:45,181
Okay, let’s just take it
slow and easy goin’ in.

486
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,827
Don’t take any chances.

487
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:16,283
Where are we, Coffey?

488
00:34:16,677 --> 00:34:20,765
This is the forward berthing compartment.
This way.

489
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:38,996
You guys okay? Cat? Jammer?

490
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:42,499
- Right behind you, Bud.
- Check your gauges.

491
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:46,640
- How’s your O₂?
- I’m okay.

492
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,060
Yeah, gauges are good.

493
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:51,811
Okay, 16 minutes to go.

494
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:04,748
<i>Jammer, your CO₂ is up.</i>

495
00:35:05,357 --> 00:35:08,110
<i>- Breathe slower, buddy.</i>
- I’m okay.

496
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,522
Come on. Let’s keep up.

497
00:35:18,629 --> 00:35:20,855
All right. Up this way
to the control center.

498
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:52,778
- It’s jammed. Give me a hand.
- Get up here with that pry bar.

499
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,945
It’s moving! Pull!

500
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,342
Jesus!

501
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,297
All right. We knew we were gonna see this.
Just move on.

502
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:18,068
- Jesus!
- Come on, Jammer. Let’s go.

503
00:36:53,536 --> 00:36:55,924
Okay, let’s stay cool.

504
00:36:57,235 --> 00:36:58,665
Everybody stay cool.

505
00:37:00,029 --> 00:37:03,223
We can’t help these guys,
but we might find somebody further in.

506
00:37:10,484 --> 00:37:12,069
Stay here.

507
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,695
Hey, Jammer. You okay?

508
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:34,343
- How you guys doin’?
- I’m dealin’.

509
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:37,936
Triple time sounded like
a lot of money, Bud. It ain’t.

510
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:39,829
We’re here.
Let’s get ’er done, okay.

511
00:37:40,352 --> 00:37:41,352
Brigman,

512
00:37:41,423 --> 00:37:43,555
take your men and continue aft.

513
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:46,056
Split up into two teams.

514
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:49,937
Come on. Let’s get moving.
We head back in 14 minutes.

515
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:51,950
Let’s go.

516
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:01,435
You okay, Jammer?

517
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,670
Yeah, fine.

518
00:38:09,218 --> 00:38:12,341
- What’s this?
- Should be the missile launch control center.

519
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:15,682
- Don’t touch anything.
- No, no, no, no, no.

520
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:18,129
This way.

521
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:20,027
Right behind you.

522
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:43,678
- You still with me, Jammer?
- Where are we?

523
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,361
Missile compartment.

524
00:38:46,545 --> 00:38:48,038
Those are the launch tubes.

525
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:59,840
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

526
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:01,585
Hey, Jammer.

527
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:06,596
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! You okay?

528
00:39:07,616 --> 00:39:09,321
Deep and slow, big guy.

529
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:11,244
Deep and slow.
Just breathe easy.

530
00:39:11,285 --> 00:39:14,400
- Everybody’s dead! They’re all dead.
- Okay.

531
00:39:14,763 --> 00:39:16,820
- I’m taking you back out. Let’s go.
- No!

532
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:18,913
I’m okay. I’m okay.

533
00:39:23,323 --> 00:39:27,954
- I just can’t go any further in.
- Okay, Jammer. No problem. Stay right here.

534
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,628
I’ve got to check out
this compartment, all right?

535
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:34,958
We’ll stay in voice contact.
You hold on the end of this rope here.

536
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:37,018
You have any problem whatsoever,

537
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:39,157
- you tug twice.
- I got it.

538
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:41,030
Pull it hard. Five more minutes.

539
00:39:41,608 --> 00:39:43,530
Just relax, all right? You’ll be okay.

540
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,292
- Okay.
- Be right back.

541
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:33,048
You still readin’ me okay, big guy?

542
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:35,555
<i>Read you fine, Bud.</i>

543
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,233
Okay,

544
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:44,329
just a few more minutes.

545
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:47,908
There’s a couple compartments up ahead
that might have air.

546
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:51,034
<i>- Okay, no problem.</i>
- We got to be sure, right?

547
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:54,091
<i>Hang on, Jammer.
You just hold on to that--</i>

548
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:01,950
Shit!

549
00:41:03,537 --> 00:41:04,538
Bud?

550
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,165
Bud, can you hear me?

551
00:41:06,405 --> 00:41:07,553
Bud?

552
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:09,383
Bud?

553
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:13,670
Goddamn it!

554
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:27,396
Oh, Jesus!

555
00:41:57,995 --> 00:41:59,242
Bud, is that you?

556
00:42:22,256 --> 00:42:24,076
Hang on, Jammer.

557
00:42:26,664 --> 00:42:29,864
Lew, Cat,
hurry up, on the double!

558
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:31,998
<i>I’m on my way.</i>

559
00:42:38,878 --> 00:42:40,172
Jammer!

560
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:45,818
- What’s the problem?
- He’s convulsing!

561
00:42:48,008 --> 00:42:50,215
It’s his mixture. Too much oxygen.

562
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:54,757
Got to get the O₂ cut down!
Turn him over!

563
00:42:56,026 --> 00:42:58,477
Crank it down, man!
You’re losin’ him!

564
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:05,219
All right. We got to get him out of here.
Let’s go. Let’s move it.

565
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:07,702
Easy, big fella.

566
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:10,108
That’s it.

567
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:13,565
One Night, do you see the divers?
Are they out yet?

568
00:43:13,706 --> 00:43:16,704
<i>Negative, Lindsey.
Haven’t seen hide nor hair.</i>

569
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:20,959
<i>Let’s give them two minutes more max,
and then I’ll sound the diver recall--</i>

570
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:43,670
<i>Lindsey, do you copy?</i>

571
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:48,170
<i>Meet me at Flatbed. This is a diver emergency.
Lins, do you copy?</i>

572
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,303
Yeah, copy you, Bud.
I’m on my way.

573
00:43:57,115 --> 00:43:58,717
Look, I’m just a medic,

574
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,892
which is mostly
about patchin’ holes.

575
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:03,514
This type of thing, it’s...

576
00:44:04,254 --> 00:44:06,804
there’s not much I can do.

577
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:09,532
A coma could last hours or days.

578
00:44:16,603 --> 00:44:18,732
So, you didn’t get anything
on these cameras.

579
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,827
No. I didn’t get a picture of it.

580
00:44:21,986 --> 00:44:24,182
- What about the video?
- No.

581
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,993
We lost power right then.

582
00:44:26,909 --> 00:44:29,355
Look, I just don’t want to
talk about this, okay?

583
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:31,675
Fine. Be that way.

584
00:44:32,164 --> 00:44:34,484
Look, I don’t know
what I saw, Bud, okay?

585
00:44:34,564 --> 00:44:38,666
Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible,
fine, it’s a Russian submersible.

586
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,072
No problem.

587
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:42,574
Yeah, but you think
it was somethin’ else.

588
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,478
What?

589
00:44:45,813 --> 00:44:47,139
One of ours?

590
00:44:50,383 --> 00:44:51,485
No.

591
00:44:52,098 --> 00:44:53,443
Well, whose then?

592
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,091
Come on, Lindsey, talk to me.

593
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,024
Look, Jammer saw something down there,

594
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:03,303
something that
scared the hell out of him.

595
00:45:03,524 --> 00:45:06,441
His mixture got screwed up.
Jammer panicked.

596
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,083
He pranged his regulator,
and his mixture got screwed up.

597
00:45:09,147 --> 00:45:11,607
But what did he see
that made him panic?

598
00:45:13,671 --> 00:45:15,431
Well, what do you think he saw?

599
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:18,744
I don’t know.

600
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:23,891
<i>- Did any of you see it?</i>
- No, sir. The Brigman woman saw it.

601
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,482
It could have been
a Russian bogey.

602
00:45:27,532 --> 00:45:29,806
<i>CINCLANTFLT’s gonna go apeshit.</i>

603
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:35,223
<i>Two Russian attack subs, a Tango and a Victor,
were tracked within 50 miles of here.</i>

604
00:45:35,503 --> 00:45:37,498
<i>Now they don’t know
where the hell they are.</i>

605
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:38,571
<i>Okay.</i>

606
00:45:40,274 --> 00:45:41,658
<i>I haven’t got any choice.</i>

607
00:45:42,668 --> 00:45:44,434
<i>I’m confirming
you to go to Phase Two.</i>

608
00:45:44,928 --> 00:45:47,091
<i>You’ll recover one warhead,
arm it</i>

609
00:45:47,335 --> 00:45:48,989
<i>and wait for
further instructions.</i>

610
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:52,629
<i>- We got a problem with that?</i>
- Negative, sir.

611
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,429
Come on!

612
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,822
- What did he say?
- Turn it up, bozo!

613
00:45:58,863 --> 00:46:01,163
<i>...early reports that
the Montana encountered</i>

614
00:46:01,204 --> 00:46:04,513
<i>a Soviet fast-attack sub
prior to its sinking,</i>

615
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:07,776
<i>and the Kremlin
continues to deny any involvement.</i>

616
00:46:08,076 --> 00:46:10,019
Oh, that’s us.
That’s us, man.

617
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,732
<i>Benthic Petroleum are apparently
participating in the recovery operation,</i>

618
00:46:13,775 --> 00:46:16,286
<i>but we have little information
about their involvement.</i>

619
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,952
Bullshit. We want names.

620
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:22,106
<i>- That’s the Explorer. We’re famous.
- Shh, quiet.</i>

621
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:25,295
<i>There is a tremendous amount of activity.</i>

622
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,701
<i>With Cuba only 80 miles away,</i>

623
00:46:27,773 --> 00:46:30,065
<i>the massive buildup
of American forces...</i>

624
00:46:30,115 --> 00:46:34,051
<i>has drawn official protest
from Havana and Moscow.</i>

625
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:38,369
<i>Russian and Cuban trawlers,
undoubtedly surveillance vessels,</i>

626
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:40,471
<i>have been circling the area,</i>

627
00:46:40,513 --> 00:46:42,599
<i>and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly...</i>

628
00:46:42,652 --> 00:46:44,712
- This sucks.
<i>- ...been warned away.</i>

629
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:47,118
Hippy, what’s the matter with you?

630
00:46:47,164 --> 00:46:49,073
What’s the matter with me? Nothing.

631
00:46:49,146 --> 00:46:51,761
We’re just in the middle of some
big-time international incident,

632
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:55,442
- like the Cuban missile crisis or something.
- Figured that out for yourself, did you, Hip?

633
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:57,863
You know, we got Russian subs
creeping around.

634
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:00,527
Anything goes wrong down here,
they could say whatever they want.

635
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,714
- Hippy, will you just relax?
- Give our folks medals.

636
00:47:02,755 --> 00:47:04,380
You’re makin’ the women nervous.

637
00:47:04,693 --> 00:47:09,322
- Cute, Virgil.
- Those SEALs ain’t telling us diddly.

638
00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:11,879
- Somethin’ is going on!
- Come on, come on.

639
00:47:11,924 --> 00:47:14,385
Hippy, you think
everything’s a conspiracy.

640
00:47:14,554 --> 00:47:16,218
Everything is.

641
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:19,194
Hurry up!
Coffey’s splitting with Flatbed.

642
00:47:19,235 --> 00:47:21,675
I showed him how to work the controls,
and they’re outta here.

643
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,830
- Didn’t you tell him we need it now?
- He didn’t pay any attention!

644
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:26,927
- Where the hell is he taking it?
- I have no idea!

645
00:47:26,968 --> 00:47:28,033
Shit!

646
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:31,287
Coffey! Come back!

647
00:47:31,634 --> 00:47:35,221
We need the big arm
to unhook the umbilical.

648
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,287
There’s a goddamn hurricane comin’!

649
00:47:38,662 --> 00:47:40,955
- He switched off.
- It’s unbelievable.

650
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,198
Go back down.

651
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,963
Tell those men
to get below and stay there.

652
00:47:58,784 --> 00:48:01,071
We need to get unhooked
and get out of here now.

653
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:02,851
All right, do it then.

654
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:05,805
No problem, except your boys
went sightseeing with Flatbed.

655
00:48:05,846 --> 00:48:08,572
My people need Flatbed
to get unhooked at their end.

656
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:11,078
- Back in two hours.
- Two hours?

657
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:14,958
We’re gonna get the shit kicked out of us
by our pal Fred in two hours.

658
00:48:21,325 --> 00:48:24,897
- Set cold tab fitting to 200 PSI.
- Set.

659
00:48:25,184 --> 00:48:28,983
There she goes.
She’s breaking loose. Bringing her up.

660
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,483
<i>Okay.
All right.</i>

661
00:48:33,262 --> 00:48:38,673
Get clear of the hatch. Keep goin’ with it.
Keep goin’. That’s it, up.

662
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,833
Sir,

663
00:48:40,173 --> 00:48:41,880
the missile looks intact.

664
00:48:42,138 --> 00:48:45,259
<i>Little is known at this hour
about the events leading up to the collision.</i>

665
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:48,221
<i>The US Navy guided missile cruiser Appleton</i>

666
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:51,271
<i>apparently struck
the Soviet Udaloy class destroyer...</i>

667
00:48:51,312 --> 00:48:53,485
<i>in low visibility conditions.</i>

668
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:57,874
<i>In violent seas, little hope remains
for over 100 Russian crewmen</i>

669
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:00,431
<i>still missing after
the sinking an hour ago.</i>

670
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:03,351
<i>Soviet military spokesmen
have claimed that the collision</i>

671
00:49:03,411 --> 00:49:05,963
<i>constituted an unprovoked attack.</i>

672
00:49:06,157 --> 00:49:08,600
<i>- This was denied by state department...</i>
- This is big time.

673
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:11,250
<i>...who said that Captain Michael Sweeney
was acting correctly--</i>

674
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,757
Okay, it’s clear.

675
00:49:14,192 --> 00:49:15,558
It’s all yours, sir.

676
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:21,401
- I’m gonna swing it away and drop it.
- Check. Okay.

677
00:49:22,221 --> 00:49:25,545
Bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer.

678
00:49:26,165 --> 00:49:30,009
- Got it?
- Separation sequencer disconnected.

679
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:34,738
Remove explosive bolts one through six
in counterclockwise sequence.

680
00:49:34,882 --> 00:49:36,801
Check. Removing bolt one.

681
00:49:45,824 --> 00:49:49,418
<i>Negotiators have walked out of
the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks</i>

682
00:49:49,459 --> 00:49:51,931
<i>in protest
over the incident this morning--</i>

683
00:49:51,972 --> 00:49:56,085
<i>The sudden deterioration of relations
with the United States and the Soviet--</i>

684
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,030
<i>Soviet buildup of tanks and aircraft
has continued.</i>

685
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:03,766
<i>Sometime this morning, all US and NATO
military forces have been put on full alert.</i>

686
00:50:03,813 --> 00:50:05,352
It’s on every channel.

687
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,951
<i>Well, you just
feel so helpless.</i>

688
00:50:08,011 --> 00:50:12,596
<i>You can see it coming,
but what can you do? What can anyone do?</i>

689
00:50:13,181 --> 00:50:15,782
<i>Hey, I mean, they love their kids, too.</i>

690
00:50:16,795 --> 00:50:18,382
<i>So, why are we doin’ this?</i>

691
00:50:18,455 --> 00:50:20,137
<i>If it happens, it happens.</i>

692
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:23,294
<i>There’s nothing
I can do about it, right?</i>

693
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,395
<i>I just don’t think about it.</i>

694
00:50:40,227 --> 00:50:43,144
All right. Let’s get their gear off!
Then clear the sub.

695
00:50:43,185 --> 00:50:46,473
We got to get it out of here!
Come on. Let’s go. Let’s move it.

696
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,839
One Night, you’re up.
Get ready to roll, baby.

697
00:50:49,895 --> 00:50:52,792
- Don’t touch that. Just back away.
- Excusez moi.

698
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:58,584
Hey, Coffey,
we are a little pressed for time.

699
00:51:02,786 --> 00:51:03,786
Prick.

700
00:51:04,846 --> 00:51:06,876
This ain’t no drill, slick.
Make me proud.

701
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,576
Piece of cake, baby.

702
00:51:43,854 --> 00:51:47,046
<i>- What’s the problem, One Night?</i>
- All hell must be breaking loose up there.

703
00:51:47,087 --> 00:51:49,007
This cable’s pissin’ me off.

704
00:51:50,629 --> 00:51:54,573
- I can’t get a grip on it.
<i>- Well, keep tryin’, baby. Just keep tryin’.</i>

705
00:51:55,982 --> 00:51:57,462
Son of a bitch!

706
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:01,466
Shit! We got a problem!

707
00:52:01,598 --> 00:52:04,209
- What’s going on?
- We’re losing number two thruster!

708
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,849
Bearing’s going!

709
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,265
It’s not holding.
We’re swinging out of position here!

710
00:52:10,306 --> 00:52:11,439
Goddamn it!

711
00:52:21,186 --> 00:52:22,566
Jesus!

712
00:52:30,216 --> 00:52:31,462
Shit!

713
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:45,159
- The rig is movin’!
- Yeah, I can see that. Topside!

714
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:47,959
Topside! Pay out some slack.
We’re gettin’ dragged.

715
00:52:48,012 --> 00:52:51,274
- Down on number one winch! Down on one!
<i>- We’re gettin’ dragged!</i>

716
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,383
Bud, we’re headed
right for the drop-off.

717
00:53:28,897 --> 00:53:32,603
What the hell?
We just lost all the topside feeds.

718
00:53:35,447 --> 00:53:38,160
Shit! Get ’em on the UQC!

719
00:53:39,824 --> 00:53:40,917
Bud!

720
00:53:41,994 --> 00:53:44,189
<i>- We lost the crane!</i>
- Say again. What?

721
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:49,496
The crane! We’ve lost the crane!
It’s on its way down to you!

722
00:53:50,476 --> 00:53:53,420
All right, everybody.
Everybody, rig for impact!

723
00:53:53,966 --> 00:53:56,393
Close all the exterior hatches!
Let’s move it! Let’s go!

724
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:57,819
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

725
00:54:00,684 --> 00:54:03,123
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Get in here!

726
00:54:05,529 --> 00:54:07,889
What the hell is goin’ on around here?

727
00:54:07,938 --> 00:54:09,898
I don’t know.

728
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,326
You two help secure the rig. Let’s go.

729
00:54:28,124 --> 00:54:31,782
One Night! One Night, you hear me? Get the
hell out of there! The crane’s comin’ down!

730
00:54:40,901 --> 00:54:42,861
<i>I’m okay. I’m clear, Bud.</i>

731
00:54:53,959 --> 00:54:56,685
I’ve got it. It’s headed straight for us.

732
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,042
Oh, shit.

733
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:18,656
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, my God!

734
00:56:19,449 --> 00:56:21,688
- Bud!
- Grab on to something!

735
00:56:27,464 --> 00:56:28,664
Jesus!

736
00:56:37,152 --> 00:56:40,326
- Battery room’s flooding! Let’s go!
- Cat, put that out!

737
00:56:42,753 --> 00:56:44,074
- Bud!
- Yeah?

738
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:46,527
- Drill room’s floodin’!
- Get back down there!

739
00:56:49,302 --> 00:56:53,002
Go! I’ll take the battery room.
Jesus!

740
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,659
Shit!

741
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:16,338
Get out of there!

742
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:19,322
Close the door! Seal the room!

743
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:31,076
Lindsey,
let’s get out of here!

744
00:57:40,642 --> 00:57:42,048
Whoa!

745
00:58:20,602 --> 00:58:22,822
- Hold this on me!
- Okay!

746
00:58:26,525 --> 00:58:28,859
Lindsey! Lindsey!

747
00:58:29,905 --> 00:58:31,072
I got it!

748
00:58:52,918 --> 00:58:54,978
Let’s get the hell out of here!

749
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,792
Let’s go!

750
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:04,030
Let’s go! Get the door!

751
00:59:04,577 --> 00:59:06,237
Get the door!

752
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,909
Jesus!

753
00:59:12,097 --> 00:59:14,596
Bud! Bud!

754
00:59:23,109 --> 00:59:24,649
Finler, cut the hose!

755
00:59:24,716 --> 00:59:26,662
Cut the line to the motor!

756
00:59:26,982 --> 00:59:29,173
I can’t open it from out here!

757
00:59:29,473 --> 00:59:31,833
Finler, cut the hose!

758
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:35,784
Finler!

759
01:00:00,761 --> 01:00:03,623
Hey! Hey!

760
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:08,147
Hey! Hey!

761
01:00:09,954 --> 01:00:13,514
- Come on, Sonny!
- Hey, Cat! Cat, help me out, man!

762
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,144
Hang on!

763
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:21,569
The hose! Cut the hose!
The line to the motor! Hurry up, man!

764
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:27,557
Come on, Cat!

765
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:29,620
Hurry!

766
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:32,632
Come on, Sonny, help me out!
Come on, push!

767
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:35,406
Come on, Sonny!

768
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:41,141
- Come on, Sonny! Let’s go!
- Come on! Let’s go! We gotta go! Go! Go!

769
01:00:41,787 --> 01:00:43,851
Get outta here!
Come on, move it!

770
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:47,397
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Get the hatch, Cat!

771
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:49,947
Get the hatch!
Get the hatch!

772
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:05,394
You all right?
Everybody okay?

773
01:01:05,435 --> 01:01:08,476
- Yeah.
- Oh, son of a bitch.

774
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,375
Oh, man.

775
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:21,509
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer,
this is Deepcore. Do you read me?

776
01:01:24,745 --> 01:01:28,230
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer,
this is Deepcore.

777
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:30,232
Do you read me? Over.

778
01:01:30,355 --> 01:01:32,578
Forget it, Sonny. They’re gone, man.

779
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:38,733
- Mayday, mayday, mayday.
- Hey.

780
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:40,667
They’re gone.

781
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,334
Okay?

782
01:01:47,765 --> 01:01:49,764
I just want to get out of this.

783
01:01:53,275 --> 01:01:55,868
Just like to see my wife
one more time.

784
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,983
Well, all right,
then you’d better keep trying, huh?

785
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:02,681
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

786
01:02:02,797 --> 01:02:04,847
This is Deepcore Two.
Do you read me?

787
01:02:05,714 --> 01:02:08,687
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer,
do you read me?

788
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,653
This is Deepcore 2. Over.

789
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:13,081
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

790
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:16,198
This is Deepcore 2.
Do you read me? Over.

791
01:02:42,034 --> 01:02:43,154
Hey, Jammer.

792
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:51,794
<i>- You got the shakes.
- I know what I got.</i>

793
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:53,482
<i>I’ll deal with it, all right?</i>

794
01:02:53,654 --> 01:02:56,028
I’ll deal with me.
You deal with yourself.

795
01:02:57,001 --> 01:02:58,487
Find your buddy?

796
01:02:59,995 --> 01:03:02,574
- No.
- Tighter. Tighter.

797
01:03:02,698 --> 01:03:04,950
- Brigman.
- What?

798
01:03:06,696 --> 01:03:08,389
I was under orders.

799
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:10,264
I had no choice.

800
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:27,972
How’s it goin’, Cat?

801
01:03:38,874 --> 01:03:40,571
What’s the scoop, ace?

802
01:03:40,774 --> 01:03:44,116
Well, I can get power
to this module in sub-bay...

803
01:03:44,247 --> 01:03:46,076
if I reroute these buses,

804
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:49,663
but I gotta get past the mains,
which are a total meltdown.

805
01:03:51,378 --> 01:03:54,209
Bud, there won’t be enough
to run the heaters.

806
01:03:54,452 --> 01:03:57,921
In a few hours, this place
is gonna be as cold as a meat locker.

807
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,621
What about O₂?

808
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:01,334
Yeah, well, brace yourself.

809
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:05,672
If we close off the sections we’re not using,
we have about maybe 12 hours’ worth.

810
01:04:08,648 --> 01:04:11,602
Storm’s gonna last
a lot longer than 12 hours.

811
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,063
Yeah, well,

812
01:04:13,685 --> 01:04:16,607
I can maybe extend that. Maybe.

813
01:04:17,197 --> 01:04:20,402
There’s some storage tanks outboard,
next to the wrecked module.

814
01:04:20,866 --> 01:04:23,786
I’ll have to go outside, though,
and tie onto them.

815
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:29,077
Hey, Lins.

816
01:04:29,571 --> 01:04:31,244
- Lins.
- Yeah?

817
01:04:32,348 --> 01:04:33,848
I’m glad you’re here.

818
01:04:34,416 --> 01:04:35,748
Yeah.

819
01:04:37,822 --> 01:04:38,993
I’m not.

820
01:05:06,475 --> 01:05:08,255
Hey. Found Cab Three.

821
01:05:08,755 --> 01:05:10,529
Deader than dogshit, boss.

822
01:05:10,835 --> 01:05:13,594
That girder went
right through the brainpan.

823
01:05:13,635 --> 01:05:15,262
Yeah, I see that.

824
01:05:18,501 --> 01:05:21,421
- Where are you?
- Living quarters, level two.

825
01:05:29,127 --> 01:05:30,993
Oh, geez.

826
01:05:33,108 --> 01:05:34,555
That’s Perry.

827
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:42,552
That’s it, then.
Finler, McWhirter, Dietz and Perry.

828
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:45,551
Jesus.

829
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:50,484
We just leave ’em there?

830
01:05:50,705 --> 01:05:52,248
Yeah, for now.
We got no choice.

831
01:05:52,289 --> 01:05:54,981
Our first priority is to get
somethin’ to breathe.

832
01:06:05,705 --> 01:06:07,484
<i>Where are you now, Lins?</i>

833
01:06:08,345 --> 01:06:10,802
I’m under the starboard tri-module.

834
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,863
- Still with me, Hip?
- Right behind you, Lins.

835
01:06:27,278 --> 01:06:28,447
How’s it look?

836
01:06:28,543 --> 01:06:30,671
<i>Well, you guys really screwed up my rig.</i>

837
01:06:30,765 --> 01:06:32,591
<i>There’s a lot of wreckage out here.</i>

838
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:34,261
Well, don’t get fouled.

839
01:06:34,807 --> 01:06:36,781
Hey, hit me with that 9/16ths, okay?

840
01:06:37,006 --> 01:06:39,425
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

841
01:06:39,494 --> 01:06:40,674
So...

842
01:06:41,494 --> 01:06:42,580
there you were.

843
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:44,414
Yeah, there we were...

844
01:06:45,462 --> 01:06:48,388
side by side on the same ship
for two months.

845
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:53,198
I’m a tool-pusher, and we’re
testing this automated derrick of hers.

846
01:06:54,361 --> 01:06:56,808
We get back on the beach
and we’re living together.

847
01:06:56,905 --> 01:06:59,324
Doesn’t mean you had to marry her.

848
01:06:59,456 --> 01:07:02,761
Well, we were due to go back out
on the same ship. Six months of tests.

849
01:07:02,802 --> 01:07:05,770
If you were married, you got a state-room.
Otherwise, it was bunks.

850
01:07:05,811 --> 01:07:08,661
Okay. Good reason. Will you come over here,
and tighten this for me?

851
01:07:09,656 --> 01:07:11,121
Then what?

852
01:07:11,212 --> 01:07:14,147
Everything was all right there
for a while, you know.

853
01:07:14,756 --> 01:07:18,249
Then she got promoted to chief engineer
on this thing a couple years ago.

854
01:07:19,163 --> 01:07:21,582
She went front-office on you, man?

855
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:23,300
Yeah, well, you know Lindsey.

856
01:07:23,766 --> 01:07:25,586
She’s just too damn aggressive...

857
01:07:25,954 --> 01:07:27,576
Son of a bitch.

858
01:07:29,198 --> 01:07:31,718
She didn’t leave me.
She just left me behind.

859
01:07:32,422 --> 01:07:34,549
Bud, let me tell you somethin’.

860
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:38,258
She ain’t half as smart
as she thinks she is.

861
01:07:42,287 --> 01:07:43,672
Get outta here.

862
01:08:18,652 --> 01:08:21,072
<i>Come on.
Let’s see those muscles.</i>

863
01:08:22,485 --> 01:08:24,195
<i>Bingo. That’s one.</i>

864
01:08:25,509 --> 01:08:26,660
Two for two.

865
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:27,997
Hey. Hey.

866
01:08:30,365 --> 01:08:32,265
Lindsey, do you read me? Over.

867
01:08:33,384 --> 01:08:35,970
Copy you, Hippy.
What’s the matter?

868
01:08:37,495 --> 01:08:40,762
Oh, shit. The power’s
jackin’ around with us again.

869
01:08:41,222 --> 01:08:42,539
Lindsey, come back.

870
01:08:42,662 --> 01:08:45,433
<i>I just lost video.
Lindsey, are you th--</i>

871
01:08:47,327 --> 01:08:49,400
Hippy, do you copy?

872
01:08:52,766 --> 01:08:54,393
Lins, you copy?

873
01:08:55,105 --> 01:08:56,479
Oh, shit!

874
01:08:57,413 --> 01:09:00,010
Oh, what the hell!
Hippy, do you copy?

875
01:09:01,548 --> 01:09:02,882
Damn it.

876
01:09:03,778 --> 01:09:05,772
Bud, do you copy? Over.

877
01:09:08,466 --> 01:09:10,775
I seem to be having a problem here.

878
01:11:29,153 --> 01:11:30,360
Shit.

879
01:11:43,895 --> 01:11:45,175
Damn it.

880
01:12:18,113 --> 01:12:21,466
- That’s a great shot, Lins.
- You drop your dive line?

881
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:23,468
Come on, you guys. Come on.

882
01:12:23,686 --> 01:12:25,870
That’s the smaller one.
That’s the smaller one here.

883
01:12:25,934 --> 01:12:28,684
- You can kinda see how it’s zigging around.
- Yeah, whatever it is.

884
01:12:28,725 --> 01:12:31,362
I’m telling you what it is.
You’re just not hearing me.

885
01:12:31,435 --> 01:12:34,452
- Now, Lindsey you--
- There is something down there.

886
01:12:34,832 --> 01:12:36,313
Something not us.

887
01:12:36,567 --> 01:12:37,999
You could be more...

888
01:12:38,164 --> 01:12:39,246
specific.

889
01:12:39,346 --> 01:12:41,412
- Something that zigs.
- Not us.

890
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:43,737
Not human.

891
01:12:44,206 --> 01:12:46,400
Get it?
Something non-human,

892
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:48,177
but intelligent.

893
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:57,049
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

894
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,484
- A Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.
- Yes.

895
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:03,634
NTIs. Oh, man, that’s better than UFOs.

896
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:07,127
Oh, but that works too, huh?
Underwater Flying Objects.

897
01:13:11,658 --> 01:13:13,921
Are we talking
little space friends here?

898
01:13:13,962 --> 01:13:17,068
Hell, yeah! Hot rods of the Gods!
Right, Lins?

899
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:20,178
No, no, really.
It could be NTIs.

900
01:13:20,252 --> 01:13:22,025
The CIA has known
about ’em forever.

901
01:13:22,092 --> 01:13:24,196
They abduct people all the time, man.

902
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,414
- Would you do me a favor?
- There was once--

903
01:13:26,455 --> 01:13:27,834
Stay off my side.

904
01:13:29,153 --> 01:13:31,193
- Will you step into my office, please?
- Certainly.

905
01:13:32,914 --> 01:13:34,967
I... come here.

906
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:38,661
- Jesus, Lins.
- Oh, Bud, come on.

907
01:13:38,702 --> 01:13:40,389
Something important
is happening here.

908
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:42,111
I’m trying to
keep this under control.

909
01:13:42,152 --> 01:13:44,531
I can’t allow you to create
this kind of hysteria.

910
01:13:44,572 --> 01:13:47,078
Who’s hysterical?! Nobody’s hysterical!

911
01:13:49,156 --> 01:13:51,380
All I’m saying is,
when you’re hangin’ on by your fingernails,

912
01:13:51,421 --> 01:13:53,075
you don’t go
waving your arms around.

913
01:13:53,116 --> 01:13:56,302
Look, I saw something. I’m not gonna
go in there and say I didn’t see it,

914
01:13:56,343 --> 01:13:58,205
when I did. I’m sorry.

915
01:13:58,438 --> 01:13:59,438
Please.

916
01:13:59,538 --> 01:14:01,510
You are the most stubborn woman
I ever knew.

917
01:14:01,564 --> 01:14:03,318
Yes. I am.

918
01:14:03,585 --> 01:14:06,047
But I need you
to believe me right now.

919
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,780
Now, come on. Look at me. Come on.
Am I stressed out?

920
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:13,579
Do I have any symptoms of pressure sickness?
Tremors, slurred speech?

921
01:14:14,705 --> 01:14:17,165
- No.
- No.

922
01:14:17,271 --> 01:14:19,867
Bud, this is me, Lindsey. Okay?

923
01:14:20,687 --> 01:14:23,715
You know me better
than anybody in the world.

924
01:14:24,688 --> 01:14:26,592
Now watch my lips.

925
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:28,980
I saw these things.

926
01:14:30,033 --> 01:14:31,900
I touched one of them, and...

927
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,767
it wasn’t some clunky steel can
like we would build.

928
01:14:38,117 --> 01:14:39,444
It glided.

929
01:14:40,428 --> 01:14:43,348
It was the most beautiful thing
I’ve ever seen.

930
01:14:44,815 --> 01:14:46,908
Oh, God, I wish you’d been there.

931
01:14:47,519 --> 01:14:51,103
It was a machine...
it was a machine, but it was alive.

932
01:14:51,144 --> 01:14:53,576
It was like a...
like a dance of light.

933
01:14:56,873 --> 01:14:59,208
Please. You have to trust me.

934
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,732
Now, I don’t think they mean us any harm.
I don’t know how I know that.

935
01:15:03,025 --> 01:15:04,151
It’s just...

936
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:05,445
a feeling.

937
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,220
Geez.

938
01:15:08,082 --> 01:15:10,479
I’m supposed to go on a feeling?
How can I go on a feeling?

939
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,653
- You think Coffey’s gonna go on “a feeling”?
- Well, we all see what we wanna see.

940
01:15:15,549 --> 01:15:17,831
Coffey looks, and he sees Russians.

941
01:15:18,293 --> 01:15:19,898
He sees hate and fear.

942
01:15:21,807 --> 01:15:24,533
You have to look
with better eyes than that.

943
01:15:29,615 --> 01:15:30,622
Please.

944
01:15:31,808 --> 01:15:33,161
I can’t, Lins.

945
01:15:34,847 --> 01:15:36,766
- No?
- I’m sorry.

946
01:15:38,295 --> 01:15:41,443
All I want is 24-hour surveillance
on the exterior cam.

947
01:15:41,484 --> 01:15:43,570
I’ve got six people, I’ve got--

948
01:15:45,525 --> 01:15:47,402
Everybody, just stop.

949
01:15:54,288 --> 01:15:55,348
All right,

950
01:15:55,992 --> 01:15:59,627
I want a round-the-clock manning
of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.

951
01:16:01,096 --> 01:16:03,910
That Russian bogey comes back,
I don’t think we should be taking a nap.

952
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:05,909
Oh, give me a break, Coffey.

953
01:16:05,974 --> 01:16:08,852
Those things live 3.5 miles down
in an abyssal trench.

954
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:11,530
Trust me, they’re not speaking Russian.

955
01:16:15,996 --> 01:16:18,796
Have you finished the repairs
on the acoustical transmitter yet?

956
01:16:18,973 --> 01:16:20,086
Nope.

957
01:16:21,042 --> 01:16:22,350
Why not?

958
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:24,537
I was having my nails done.

959
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:26,305
Well, get it done.

960
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,519
Kiss my ass.

961
01:16:40,834 --> 01:16:42,107
All right,

962
01:16:42,808 --> 01:16:44,565
get somethin’ straight.

963
01:16:46,005 --> 01:16:47,858
You people are under my authority.

964
01:16:48,005 --> 01:16:50,085
- Look, podner.
- When I give you an ord--

965
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,800
Look, podner,
we don’t work for you,

966
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:54,548
we don’t take orders from you...

967
01:16:55,595 --> 01:16:57,461
and we don’t much like you.

968
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:02,041
Hey, Cat.

969
01:17:02,543 --> 01:17:03,547
Cat!

970
01:17:05,218 --> 01:17:06,222
Yeah?

971
01:17:06,482 --> 01:17:09,615
Why don’t you take
the first watch on sonar, okay?

972
01:17:11,588 --> 01:17:12,661
Right on.

973
01:17:14,107 --> 01:17:17,568
Sonny, you get a couple hours sleep,
then you spell Cat, all right?

974
01:17:18,115 --> 01:17:20,725
Hippy, you handle
exterior surveillance.

975
01:17:22,477 --> 01:17:23,690
One Night.

976
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:28,451
Would you do me a favor
and see if you can get that transmitter fixed?

977
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:31,610
- All right?
- Be a couple hours.

978
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:42,388
Got it.

979
01:18:05,266 --> 01:18:06,666
All right.

980
01:18:07,139 --> 01:18:11,316
Come on, A.J. Squared Away,
a little to the left.

981
01:18:12,442 --> 01:18:14,162
What is that?

982
01:18:22,211 --> 01:18:24,755
Oh, this is not happening.

983
01:18:27,974 --> 01:18:29,542
Oh, man.

984
01:18:32,936 --> 01:18:35,450
Look at me. I’m shakin’.
All right, wait, wait, wait.

985
01:18:35,506 --> 01:18:37,100
And now...

986
01:18:37,527 --> 01:18:40,653
here’s MIRV.

987
01:18:44,297 --> 01:18:46,643
Come on, man.
What else could it be?

988
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:48,279
Why bring it here?

989
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:52,735
It’s gotta be some kind of emergency plan
to keep it away from the Russians, right.

990
01:18:52,887 --> 01:18:55,765
Look, they hot-wire one of the nukes,

991
01:18:56,019 --> 01:18:58,401
they use some kind of detonator
that they brought,

992
01:18:58,446 --> 01:19:02,066
then they stick it back in the sub,
fry the whole thing up.

993
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,615
Bam! Slicker’n snot.

994
01:19:06,966 --> 01:19:10,010
I’m tellin’ ya. And I’m not bein’ paranoi--

995
01:19:10,971 --> 01:19:12,362
Hi, Lins.

996
01:19:20,816 --> 01:19:22,851
Lins, will you just
wait a second.

997
01:19:22,951 --> 01:19:25,387
Goddamn it, if you don’t do
something about it, I will!

998
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:27,830
Lindsey, we’ll do something about it!
Just wait a second!

999
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,777
- Lindsey.
- What?

1000
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:33,564
- Just stop and think about this for a second.
- What?

1001
01:19:54,406 --> 01:19:57,409
You know, you’ve got some huevos
bringing that thing into my rig.

1002
01:19:58,976 --> 01:20:03,083
With all that’s going on up in the world,
you bring a nuclear weapon in here?

1003
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,317
Mrs. Brigman...

1004
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:08,452
Does this strike anyone
as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?

1005
01:20:08,935 --> 01:20:12,472
Mrs. Brigman, you don’t need to know
the details of our operation.

1006
01:20:12,545 --> 01:20:15,445
- It’s better if you don’t.
- You’re right. I don’t need to know.

1007
01:20:15,486 --> 01:20:19,646
What I need to know is that thing
is off this rig! Do you hear me, Roger Ramjet?

1008
01:20:22,057 --> 01:20:24,657
You’re becoming
a serious impediment to our mission.

1009
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:26,878
Now, you either do an about-face

1010
01:20:27,096 --> 01:20:29,871
and walk out of here,
or I’ll have you escorted out.

1011
01:20:29,921 --> 01:20:33,091
I will not do an about-face
and get out of here.

1012
01:20:33,213 --> 01:20:35,590
Who the hell do you
think you’re talking to?

1013
01:20:35,856 --> 01:20:38,991
Emergency! Maintenance Room B!
Everybody move it!

1014
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,432
- On the double!
- Now! Now!

1015
01:20:42,139 --> 01:20:44,735
In here! Come on! We’ve got trouble!

1016
01:20:44,782 --> 01:20:46,886
- Now! Come on!
- What’s goin’ on?

1017
01:20:46,932 --> 01:20:49,356
All right, all right, all right, all right!

1018
01:20:50,205 --> 01:20:51,913
What’s up? What’s happening?

1019
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:53,950
All right, you let
her go, man. Do it.

1020
01:20:54,368 --> 01:20:55,570
Do it now!

1021
01:20:56,163 --> 01:20:57,437
Let her go.

1022
01:21:00,514 --> 01:21:02,655
The smartest thing you ever did.

1023
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,092
- Coffey, you son of a bitch--
- Lindsey! Cool it.

1024
01:21:08,156 --> 01:21:10,026
- What’s the problem?
- Nothin’.

1025
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:13,555
We were just leaving,
weren’t we?

1026
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,554
We don’t need them.

1027
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:38,731
We can’t trust them.

1028
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:45,285
We may have to take steps.

1029
01:21:47,966 --> 01:21:49,903
We’re gonna have to take steps.

1030
01:21:54,819 --> 01:21:57,459
Lins, I want you to stay away
from that guy.

1031
01:21:57,605 --> 01:21:59,707
- I mean it.
- The guy is gone.

1032
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,667
Did you see his hands?

1033
01:22:01,801 --> 01:22:03,678
What? He’s got the shakes?

1034
01:22:03,837 --> 01:22:06,067
Look, he’s operating on his own,

1035
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,322
he’s cut off from
his chain of command,

1036
01:22:08,363 --> 01:22:11,364
he’s showing signs
of pressure-induced psychosis...

1037
01:22:11,765 --> 01:22:14,058
and he’s got a nuclear weapon.

1038
01:22:14,865 --> 01:22:18,549
So, as a personal favor to me, will you try
to put your tongue in neutral for a while.

1039
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:23,512
I gotta tell you, I give this whole thing
a sphincter factor of about 9.5.

1040
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:06,101
Look, you can just punch into his
primary guidance chip where you want him to go

1041
01:23:06,142 --> 01:23:07,437
and he’ll go there, right?

1042
01:23:07,478 --> 01:23:11,063
- No. Bad idea, Lindsey. Bad.
- Why? Hip, come on.

1043
01:23:11,104 --> 01:23:13,857
Because even if it could take
the pressure at that depth,

1044
01:23:13,898 --> 01:23:16,164
- which, I don’t think it can--
- Yeah?

1045
01:23:16,233 --> 01:23:18,726
Without the tether, know what
would happen if it got down there?

1046
01:23:18,767 --> 01:23:22,193
It would just sit like a-- Please.
It would just sit like a dumb shit.

1047
01:23:22,286 --> 01:23:25,556
Yeah, something would have to pass in front
of the camera for you to see anything.

1048
01:23:25,597 --> 01:23:27,772
I know. But we could get lucky, right?

1049
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:29,354
So, we should go for it.

1050
01:23:30,057 --> 01:23:32,988
<i>- I ought to talk to Bud about this.
- No way. This is between you and me.</i>

1051
01:23:33,029 --> 01:23:35,172
<i>We get proof,
and then we tell the others.</i>

1052
01:23:35,692 --> 01:23:40,029
<i>Hippy, look. If we can prove to Coffey
that there aren’t Russians down there,</i>

1053
01:23:40,604 --> 01:23:43,343
<i>maybe he’ll ease off the button a little bit.</i>

1054
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:48,602
<i>I gotta tell you, man, that guy scares me more
than anything we’re gonna find down there.</i>

1055
01:23:48,658 --> 01:23:53,445
<i>He’s a goddamn A.J. Squared Away,
jarhead robot.</i>

1056
01:23:56,848 --> 01:23:59,203
<i>All right, gimme a couple hours
to see what I can do.</i>

1057
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:00,538
<i>Great. Thanks.</i>

1058
01:24:09,656 --> 01:24:10,961
How’s that?

1059
01:24:15,264 --> 01:24:16,404
Thanks.

1060
01:24:39,385 --> 01:24:41,452
Virgil, turn on your side.

1061
01:25:11,185 --> 01:25:13,853
All right, you’re all set, big guy.

1062
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:16,983
Hey, I told you
to wipe that grin off your face.

1063
01:25:26,179 --> 01:25:27,818
Good night, little buddy.

1064
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,380
Bud. Bud.

1065
01:27:18,847 --> 01:27:20,333
Bud! Get up.

1066
01:27:23,505 --> 01:27:24,875
What?

1067
01:27:35,113 --> 01:27:36,182
Cat.

1068
01:27:38,706 --> 01:27:40,317
- Cat!
- Hey!

1069
01:27:40,358 --> 01:27:42,314
Goddamn-- leave me alone.

1070
01:27:50,982 --> 01:27:52,035
Bud.

1071
01:27:55,441 --> 01:27:56,953
Wait. It’s okay.

1072
01:27:57,709 --> 01:27:59,495
Sweet Christ Almighty.

1073
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:01,074
I think it likes you.

1074
01:28:21,622 --> 01:28:23,472
It’s trying to communicate.

1075
01:28:25,543 --> 01:28:26,843
That’s Bud.

1076
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:33,110
- It’s wonderful!
- It’s me!

1077
01:28:36,892 --> 01:28:38,979
- No, no, no.
- Shh. It’s okay.

1078
01:28:39,074 --> 01:28:40,784
What is it?

1079
01:28:43,547 --> 01:28:45,192
Is it alive?

1080
01:28:48,716 --> 01:28:50,760
Lindsey, no.

1081
01:28:52,253 --> 01:28:53,706
Seawater.

1082
01:28:54,275 --> 01:28:55,658
Oh, man.

1083
01:29:09,448 --> 01:29:11,156
Come on. Come on!

1084
01:29:13,518 --> 01:29:15,395
- Hurry!
- Where the hell’s it goin’?

1085
01:29:26,575 --> 01:29:29,060
Hurry! I think it’s headed for “B” module.

1086
01:29:30,311 --> 01:29:32,055
Lins, you see it?

1087
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:35,009
So, raise your hand if you think
that was a Russian water tentacle.

1088
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:37,683
Lieutenant?

1089
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:40,060
No? Well.

1090
01:30:41,582 --> 01:30:42,963
A breakthrough.

1091
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:46,613
Hey, ace, you done impressin’ yourself?

1092
01:30:46,742 --> 01:30:48,902
No way that thing
could just be seawater.

1093
01:30:50,033 --> 01:30:52,013
They must have learned
to control water.

1094
01:30:52,149 --> 01:30:53,973
I mean, at a molecular level.

1095
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:56,775
You know, they can plasticize it,
they can polymerize it,

1096
01:30:56,816 --> 01:31:00,763
do whatever they want to do with it.
They can put it under intelligent control.

1097
01:31:01,008 --> 01:31:02,038
Maybe...

1098
01:31:02,644 --> 01:31:04,903
their whole technology’s based on that.

1099
01:31:05,267 --> 01:31:07,013
- What?
- Controlling water.

1100
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:11,454
Was it the same thing
that you saw the last time?

1101
01:31:11,568 --> 01:31:12,464
No.

1102
01:31:12,505 --> 01:31:16,413
You know, I don’t think
that that thing you saw was one of them.

1103
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:20,105
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, I don’t think it was an NTI,

1104
01:31:20,148 --> 01:31:24,303
I think it was their version of an ROV,
like Big Geek.

1105
01:31:25,542 --> 01:31:28,452
- You mean they was just checkin’ us out?
- Yeah.

1106
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:31,336
- How come?
- Curious, I suppose.

1107
01:31:31,435 --> 01:31:34,675
We’re probably the first people that have
ever seen one. Who’s been down this far?

1108
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:39,075
Sure hope they
don’t judge the rest of us by him.

1109
01:31:51,595 --> 01:31:53,341
Went straight for the warhead,

1110
01:31:53,403 --> 01:31:55,461
and they think it’s cute.

1111
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:16,506
You need to get some sleep.

1112
01:32:26,823 --> 01:32:28,375
We have no...

1113
01:32:28,638 --> 01:32:31,900
way of warning the surface.

1114
01:32:32,721 --> 01:32:34,644
And you know what that means?

1115
01:32:37,645 --> 01:32:39,731
It means whatever happens...

1116
01:32:40,437 --> 01:32:42,314
is up to us.

1117
01:32:43,162 --> 01:32:44,499
Us.

1118
01:33:53,249 --> 01:33:55,940
So, you think they’re
from down there originally,

1119
01:33:55,998 --> 01:33:57,066
or from...

1120
01:33:58,413 --> 01:33:59,481
you know...

1121
01:34:01,005 --> 01:34:02,751
I don’t know.

1122
01:34:02,813 --> 01:34:05,435
I think...
I think they’re from “you know”.

1123
01:34:06,063 --> 01:34:09,267
Some place with similar conditions...
cold, intense pressure.

1124
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,619
Oh, man.

1125
01:34:10,928 --> 01:34:13,463
Happy as hogs in a waller
down there, prob’ly.

1126
01:35:12,713 --> 01:35:14,237
Sniff somethin’?

1127
01:35:18,244 --> 01:35:20,163
Did you, rat boy?

1128
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:26,413
Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on!

1129
01:35:26,688 --> 01:35:29,232
Freeze! Don’t move!

1130
01:35:31,596 --> 01:35:32,911
That’s right.

1131
01:35:34,151 --> 01:35:36,030
- You okay, Hip?
- They’re using Big Geek

1132
01:35:36,071 --> 01:35:38,127
to take the bomb to the NTIs.

1133
01:35:38,194 --> 01:35:39,194
What?

1134
01:35:39,394 --> 01:35:42,523
- We set it up to go right to ’em.
- Oh, my God.

1135
01:35:43,217 --> 01:35:44,623
Oh, my God.

1136
01:35:44,868 --> 01:35:47,071
Take this.
We’re going to Phase Three.

1137
01:35:47,978 --> 01:35:50,330
What? We don’t have orders for that!

1138
01:35:50,823 --> 01:35:52,055
I programmed Big Geek

1139
01:35:52,096 --> 01:35:54,900
to go down to the bottom of the trench
and shoot some video.

1140
01:35:54,962 --> 01:35:58,252
- Now they’ve got the warhead tied to it.
- Coffey?

1141
01:36:01,223 --> 01:36:03,062
- Linds--
- Coffey-- No. Come on.

1142
01:36:03,168 --> 01:36:06,253
Coffey, just think about
what you’re doing, okay, just one minute.

1143
01:36:06,294 --> 01:36:08,190
Just think about what you’re doing!

1144
01:36:08,272 --> 01:36:09,763
Get back!

1145
01:36:11,994 --> 01:36:15,531
This is something I’ve wanted to do
since we first met.

1146
01:36:23,548 --> 01:36:25,922
Easy. Easy.
Take it easy.

1147
01:36:27,827 --> 01:36:29,775
All right!
Into the kitchen! Let’s go!

1148
01:36:29,816 --> 01:36:32,044
- Move, partner!
- Get your damn hands off of me!

1149
01:36:32,085 --> 01:36:33,958
- Get in there!
- I know the way.

1150
01:36:33,999 --> 01:36:37,207
Your boss is fixin’
to pull the pin on 50 kilotons,

1151
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,160
and we’re all gonna be ringside!

1152
01:36:40,397 --> 01:36:42,816
He’s having a full-on meltdown!

1153
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:44,370
What’s the timer set for?

1154
01:36:44,451 --> 01:36:45,958
- Three hours.
- Shut up. Don’t talk.

1155
01:36:46,005 --> 01:36:47,211
Three hours?

1156
01:36:47,358 --> 01:36:50,455
We can’t get to minimum safe distance
in three hours.

1157
01:36:51,908 --> 01:36:53,812
We can’t go to Phase Three.
What about these people?

1158
01:36:53,853 --> 01:36:55,002
Shut up.

1159
01:36:55,131 --> 01:36:56,842
What’s the matter with you?

1160
01:37:03,084 --> 01:37:04,908
Everybody just stay calm.

1161
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:06,937
The situation is under control.

1162
01:37:12,259 --> 01:37:15,137
Anybody touches that door,
kill ’em.

1163
01:37:19,414 --> 01:37:22,644
Schoenick, your lieutenant’s about to make
a real bad career move.

1164
01:37:22,685 --> 01:37:25,286
- The guy’s crazier than a shithouse rat!
- Schoenick!

1165
01:37:25,383 --> 01:37:28,058
- They’re trying to make contact!
- Can’t you see he’s lost it?

1166
01:37:28,192 --> 01:37:30,698
- Shut up!
- The shock wave’ll kill us.

1167
01:37:30,784 --> 01:37:33,623
- Quiet!
- It’ll crush this rig like a beer can.

1168
01:37:33,677 --> 01:37:36,029
- Shut up! What are you talkin’ about!?
- We gotta stop him.

1169
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:37,462
Shut up!

1170
01:37:37,798 --> 01:37:41,051
This is not our mission.
We can’t detonate without orders.

1171
01:37:41,097 --> 01:37:42,431
Schoenick, please!

1172
01:37:55,728 --> 01:37:58,438
Schoenick, listen! He’s about to declare war
on an alien species

1173
01:37:58,479 --> 01:38:01,723
just when they’re trying to
make contact with us! Please!

1174
01:38:01,787 --> 01:38:04,155
- I don’t know. I think I’m reaching him.
- Yeah!

1175
01:38:08,223 --> 01:38:09,674
I’ll be damned.

1176
01:38:12,487 --> 01:38:14,627
- Jammer!
- Is everybody okay?

1177
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,047
Oh, man!

1178
01:38:18,065 --> 01:38:21,301
- Don’t move, jarface!
- I’m the least of your problems.

1179
01:38:21,385 --> 01:38:23,212
- Take it easy, Hippy.
- I’m all right.

1180
01:38:23,612 --> 01:38:25,142
How you feelin’, big guy?

1181
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:27,137
I’m okay, Bud, I...

1182
01:38:27,249 --> 01:38:28,342
I just...

1183
01:38:28,705 --> 01:38:32,875
I just figured I was dead back there
when I saw that angel comin’ for me.

1184
01:38:35,786 --> 01:38:36,866
Yeah, okay.

1185
01:38:38,071 --> 01:38:40,148
Yeah. Why don’t you
tell us about it later?

1186
01:38:46,299 --> 01:38:47,472
Come on.

1187
01:38:47,845 --> 01:38:49,966
He’s got it tied off with somethin’.

1188
01:38:50,082 --> 01:38:51,233
Ready?

1189
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:56,453
We’re not gonna be able to budge it.

1190
01:38:56,812 --> 01:38:59,486
Now what?
This is the only door to sub-bay.

1191
01:39:10,982 --> 01:39:13,688
- What are you doing?
- I’m gonna swim to hatch six.

1192
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,049
What?

1193
01:39:17,305 --> 01:39:20,882
I’m gonna get inside and I’m gonna
open the door from the other side.

1194
01:39:20,939 --> 01:39:22,935
Bud, this water is freezing.

1195
01:39:23,899 --> 01:39:26,087
Then I guess
you’d better wish me luck.

1196
01:39:26,234 --> 01:39:28,121
- Wish us luck.
- You comin’ along?

1197
01:39:28,162 --> 01:39:29,431
Looks that way.

1198
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:34,216
- All right, Cat.
- Come on, Bud.

1199
01:39:35,227 --> 01:39:37,884
- In case I don’t die.
- This is insane.

1200
01:39:38,143 --> 01:39:40,993
Come on, Bud.
Let’s go, podner. I ain’t got all day.

1201
01:40:41,489 --> 01:40:43,102
Come on, yank on it.

1202
01:40:49,021 --> 01:40:50,401
Gonna have to...

1203
01:40:51,247 --> 01:40:52,771
Hafta go to the moon pool.

1204
01:40:53,891 --> 01:40:55,938
- It’s the only way.
- I can’t.

1205
01:40:56,351 --> 01:40:58,099
I can’t make it, podner.

1206
01:40:58,492 --> 01:40:59,739
I’m sorry.

1207
01:41:02,081 --> 01:41:03,088
Okay.

1208
01:41:03,528 --> 01:41:04,535
Okay, Cat.

1209
01:41:04,724 --> 01:41:06,282
You head on back, all right?

1210
01:41:16,602 --> 01:41:17,742
Shit!

1211
01:42:40,874 --> 01:42:43,634
- What is he doing?
- He can’t make it to the door.

1212
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:46,033
He’s gonna try and take him out himself.

1213
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:49,853
No. God, he couldn’t be that dumb.
That guy’s a trained killer.

1214
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:40,561
No!

1215
01:43:41,219 --> 01:43:42,221
Coffey.

1216
01:43:43,010 --> 01:43:44,234
Coffey, listen...

1217
01:43:57,758 --> 01:43:58,904
Hey!

1218
01:45:19,087 --> 01:45:20,161
Hey!

1219
01:45:36,169 --> 01:45:38,849
- Bud, you all right?
- Get him, Cat!

1220
01:45:45,285 --> 01:45:46,631
He’s dogged it, Bud.

1221
01:45:46,852 --> 01:45:48,395
We gotta get this off of here.

1222
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:55,498
Come on, help me.
Pull the gripper! Pull it!

1223
01:46:06,133 --> 01:46:07,500
Cat, get the door.

1224
01:46:17,786 --> 01:46:18,786
Shit!

1225
01:46:19,749 --> 01:46:20,988
Come on!

1226
01:46:22,925 --> 01:46:24,955
- Shoot! Shoot!
- Are you all right?

1227
01:46:24,996 --> 01:46:27,018
The safety’s on!
Safety’s on!

1228
01:46:27,658 --> 01:46:29,185
Give me that!

1229
01:46:34,786 --> 01:46:36,699
Come on, let’s go!
Help me out!

1230
01:46:36,779 --> 01:46:39,659
- Give me a hand! Move it!
- One Night, what about Cab One?

1231
01:46:39,704 --> 01:46:41,164
Ready to launch.

1232
01:46:42,686 --> 01:46:45,280
Go! You’re better in these than I am!

1233
01:46:45,951 --> 01:46:47,771
You got air? Come on, come on.

1234
01:46:50,072 --> 01:46:51,822
You got air. You got air.

1235
01:47:44,022 --> 01:47:45,143
Shit.

1236
01:49:16,891 --> 01:49:18,611
Bud, get out of the way!

1237
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:26,833
Shit!

1238
01:49:49,467 --> 01:49:51,754
Get in! Hurry up!

1239
01:49:52,269 --> 01:49:55,487
I’m comin’, baby.
Keep your pantyhose on.

1240
01:50:05,003 --> 01:50:07,173
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1241
01:50:10,638 --> 01:50:12,564
- Do you see Big Geek?
- Yeah.

1242
01:50:12,954 --> 01:50:14,284
Right out in front.

1243
01:50:21,143 --> 01:50:22,885
- Oh, my God!
- Get after him!

1244
01:50:22,926 --> 01:50:24,750
- Okay, okay! Get on the arm.
- Ease up.

1245
01:50:24,836 --> 01:50:27,526
- To the left. A little more.
- You missed. Try it again.

1246
01:50:27,567 --> 01:50:29,409
- Stand steady.
- Okay.

1247
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:30,936
- Grab it.
- Yeah. Got it!

1248
01:50:31,556 --> 01:50:33,801
- Pretty slick, Slick.
- Hold it really steady.

1249
01:50:33,853 --> 01:50:36,381
- Just hold it still.
- I am. I am.

1250
01:50:47,336 --> 01:50:49,444
Shit! We lost Geek!

1251
01:50:56,245 --> 01:50:59,079
- Where is he, Bud? Do you see him?
- I’ll take a look.

1252
01:51:01,329 --> 01:51:03,348
He’s comin’ up fast.
Step on it.

1253
01:51:03,397 --> 01:51:04,648
Shit!

1254
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:17,749
- Go to the right. Swing to the right.
- Shit.

1255
01:51:34,285 --> 01:51:35,725
Keep movin’, baby.

1256
01:51:38,213 --> 01:51:39,449
Come here.

1257
01:51:45,719 --> 01:51:47,413
That son of a bitch.

1258
01:51:55,228 --> 01:51:57,522
Hard left, baby. Left, left, left!

1259
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:12,835
Jesus Christ, lady.

1260
01:52:12,929 --> 01:52:15,858
Bud, if you think you can do any better,
then you’re welcome up here!

1261
01:52:22,802 --> 01:52:24,349
Son of a bitch.

1262
01:52:26,785 --> 01:52:29,098
- Is he right on us?
- Yeah, he is right on your ass.

1263
01:52:29,139 --> 01:52:31,637
- Okay. Okay.
- Where you goin’?

1264
01:52:31,697 --> 01:52:32,878
Hang on.

1265
01:54:16,972 --> 01:54:20,065
Deepcore, this is Cab One. Do you read?

1266
01:54:22,354 --> 01:54:24,694
Deepcore, Deepcore,
this is Cab One. Over.

1267
01:54:26,618 --> 01:54:28,369
I’m not getting any answer.

1268
01:54:30,005 --> 01:54:32,005
And we’re flooding
like a son of a bitch.

1269
01:54:32,058 --> 01:54:33,633
Yeah? You noticed?

1270
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:37,590
You know, you did okay back there, Virgil.
I was fairly impressed.

1271
01:54:37,724 --> 01:54:41,399
Yeah, well, not good enough.
We still gotta catch Big Geek.

1272
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,333
Yeah? Well, not in this thing.

1273
01:54:43,473 --> 01:54:46,350
Deepcore, Deepcore,
this is Cab One. Over.

1274
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:51,080
Try it again.

1275
01:54:51,587 --> 01:54:53,936
Deepcore, this is Cab One.
We need as--

1276
01:54:58,114 --> 01:54:59,208
You all right?

1277
01:54:59,915 --> 01:55:01,248
Yeah.

1278
01:55:07,472 --> 01:55:09,985
- Well, that’s that.
- Yeah. Wonderful.

1279
01:55:12,210 --> 01:55:15,564
There’s light comin’ from somewhere.
It’s off to the right.

1280
01:55:16,030 --> 01:55:17,584
Yeah. That’s the rig.

1281
01:55:17,668 --> 01:55:19,837
It’s a good 60, 70 yards, I’d say.

1282
01:55:20,336 --> 01:55:21,843
Well, they’ll come after us.

1283
01:55:22,656 --> 01:55:25,085
Yeah, but it’s gonna take ’em
a while to get here.

1284
01:55:25,402 --> 01:55:27,321
We gotta get this flooding stopped.

1285
01:55:29,531 --> 01:55:32,807
- Can you see where it’s coming in?
- Yeah. Can you hold the lamp for me?

1286
01:55:32,848 --> 01:55:34,625
There’s a busted fitting
behind this panel.

1287
01:55:34,666 --> 01:55:37,041
Problem is, I don’t think
I can get to it.

1288
01:55:40,111 --> 01:55:43,184
- You got any tools?
- I don’t know. I’ll have to look around.

1289
01:55:43,487 --> 01:55:45,364
Yeah, well, I looked already.

1290
01:55:47,912 --> 01:55:51,117
Goddamn it, all I need
is a goddamn crescent wrench.

1291
01:55:54,113 --> 01:55:55,273
Come on.

1292
01:56:00,277 --> 01:56:01,481
Shit!

1293
01:56:01,522 --> 01:56:02,917
Son of a bitch!

1294
01:56:03,618 --> 01:56:04,618
Okay,

1295
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:05,911
calm down, Bud.

1296
01:56:06,487 --> 01:56:07,897
- Calm down.
- Okay.

1297
01:56:07,938 --> 01:56:08,944
Okay.

1298
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:12,826
Okay.

1299
01:56:15,538 --> 01:56:18,958
- We gotta get you out of here.
- How?

1300
01:56:19,057 --> 01:56:22,077
- I don’t know how.
- All right, we’ve only got one suit.

1301
01:56:22,272 --> 01:56:24,822
- We’ve gotta come up with s--
- Oh, my God. I’m freezing.

1302
01:56:24,863 --> 01:56:27,644
Come here. Come here.
Give me your hands.

1303
01:56:27,774 --> 01:56:31,587
Listen, you’re smart. Think of somethin’.
Can’t you think of somethin’?

1304
01:56:31,635 --> 01:56:35,447
Okay, why don’t you swim back to the rig
and bring back another suit.

1305
01:56:36,725 --> 01:56:40,194
That’d take me about
seven, eight minutes to swim,

1306
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:42,838
get the gear,
come back.

1307
01:56:43,418 --> 01:56:46,461
I wouldn’t make it. Look at this.
By the time I got back, you’d be...

1308
01:56:47,842 --> 01:56:49,456
- Okay. Okay. Let’s look around.
- Lins.

1309
01:56:49,587 --> 01:56:51,997
Just look a--
Oh, my God.

1310
01:56:53,710 --> 01:56:55,163
Is that working?

1311
01:56:56,771 --> 01:56:58,194
Shit.

1312
01:57:09,144 --> 01:57:12,499
- All right. All right, all right. Here.
- Bud, I’m getting cold.

1313
01:57:12,833 --> 01:57:13,685
You put this on.

1314
01:57:13,726 --> 01:57:15,445
No! Are you
growing gills all of a sudden?

1315
01:57:15,486 --> 01:57:17,576
Don’t argue with me, goddamnit.
Just put it on.

1316
01:57:17,636 --> 01:57:19,533
This is not an option,
so just forget about it.

1317
01:57:19,574 --> 01:57:22,059
Lindsey, shut up!
Shut up and put this thing on!

1318
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:24,633
- If you’d be logical for one-- Please listen!
- Fuck logic!

1319
01:57:24,807 --> 01:57:26,461
Just listen to me for one second.

1320
01:57:26,509 --> 01:57:29,781
You’ve got the suit on, and you’re a
much better swimmer than I am, right?

1321
01:57:29,822 --> 01:57:32,221
- Yeah, maybe--
- Right? Yes. So, I’ve got a plan.

1322
01:57:32,441 --> 01:57:33,656
What’s the plan?

1323
01:57:34,149 --> 01:57:35,768
I drown, and you
tow me back to the rig.

1324
01:57:35,809 --> 01:57:37,160
No. No!

1325
01:57:37,201 --> 01:57:40,085
Yes. This water is only
a couple of degrees above freezing.

1326
01:57:40,126 --> 01:57:42,738
I’d go into deep hypothermia.

1327
01:57:42,858 --> 01:57:45,174
My blood’ll go like ice water.
Right?

1328
01:57:45,219 --> 01:57:47,400
My body systems will slow down.
They won’t stop.

1329
01:57:47,441 --> 01:57:49,667
- Lins--
- You tow me back and I can...

1330
01:57:49,735 --> 01:57:53,280
I can be revived after
maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

1331
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:56,358
- Lins, put this on! You put it on!
- No! It’s the only way.

1332
01:57:56,409 --> 01:57:59,544
You just put this on!
Put this on. You know I’m right.

1333
01:57:59,908 --> 01:58:01,440
Please. It’s the only way.

1334
01:58:01,481 --> 01:58:04,818
You’ve got all the... stuff...
on the rig to do this.

1335
01:58:04,949 --> 01:58:07,159
Put this on.
Bud, please!

1336
01:58:08,284 --> 01:58:09,650
This is insane.

1337
01:58:10,465 --> 01:58:12,874
- Oh, my God. I know.
- You okay?

1338
01:58:12,915 --> 01:58:14,115
It’s the only way.

1339
01:58:14,955 --> 01:58:16,312
Here, hold this.

1340
01:58:20,103 --> 01:58:21,522
- Just hold on.
- Okay.

1341
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,774
You can do this, you know.

1342
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:32,472
You can do this.

1343
01:58:32,652 --> 01:58:34,489
- Oh, God, Lins, I...
- I know.

1344
01:58:34,673 --> 01:58:36,292
You can tell me later.

1345
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,904
Oh, God!

1346
01:58:48,698 --> 01:58:49,951
Oh, God!

1347
01:58:54,044 --> 01:58:56,922
This is maybe
not such a good idea!

1348
01:58:58,261 --> 01:59:00,045
Oh, my God!

1349
01:59:00,612 --> 01:59:02,469
Bud! No!

1350
01:59:11,845 --> 01:59:12,872
I can’t...

1351
01:59:13,276 --> 01:59:15,212
Oh, Bud, I’m scared!

1352
01:59:46,233 --> 01:59:49,947
No!

1353
02:00:12,858 --> 02:00:14,179
I got him! I got him!

1354
02:00:14,270 --> 02:00:16,525
- Where?
- Oh, my God. It’s Lindsey.

1355
02:00:16,578 --> 02:00:19,404
<i>- Deepcore! Deepcore, do you read? Over.</i>
- Yeah, we got you, Bud.

1356
02:00:19,445 --> 02:00:21,938
<i>- We’re here.</i>
- Go to the infirmary.

1357
02:00:22,331 --> 02:00:25,680
Get the cart oxygen, de-fib kit,

1358
02:00:25,986 --> 02:00:29,342
adrenaline in a 10cc syringe,
some heating blankets.

1359
02:00:29,383 --> 02:00:31,095
- You got all that?
- Got it. Over.

1360
02:00:31,154 --> 02:00:34,362
<i>- Meet me at the moon pool! Make it fast!</i>
- Now! Come on! Let’s go!

1361
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:37,369
- Hippy, get the hot packs.
- Got ’em.

1362
02:00:54,397 --> 02:00:55,741
Here he comes!

1363
02:01:02,335 --> 02:01:04,340
- Get her up.
- Watch her head. Watch her head.

1364
02:01:04,381 --> 02:01:06,681
- I got it. I got it.
- Watch her feet.

1365
02:01:09,947 --> 02:01:12,525
Watch her head comin’ down.
Watch it.

1366
02:01:18,487 --> 02:01:19,592
Clear it out.
Clear it out.

1367
02:01:19,633 --> 02:01:21,555
- Come on!
- Is she clear?

1368
02:01:21,615 --> 02:01:23,868
Get the de-fib ready.
Hurry up, Cat.

1369
02:01:23,916 --> 02:01:25,661
Okay, okay. Got it.

1370
02:01:27,425 --> 02:01:28,798
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1371
02:01:29,822 --> 02:01:32,376
3,000,
4,000,

1372
02:01:32,452 --> 02:01:34,154
- 5,000.
- Breathe!

1373
02:01:35,113 --> 02:01:38,113
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000--

1374
02:01:38,247 --> 02:01:41,068
No! Won’t work!
You gotta have bare skin, or it won’t work.

1375
02:01:41,565 --> 02:01:44,238
3,000, 4,000... Breathe.

1376
02:01:44,796 --> 02:01:45,818
Here.

1377
02:01:47,195 --> 02:01:48,905
- Is that right?
- I got it, Bud.

1378
02:01:48,946 --> 02:01:50,286
Well, do it!

1379
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:51,472
Breathe!

1380
02:01:52,439 --> 02:01:54,715
- Come on, zap her.
- Clear!

1381
02:01:56,581 --> 02:01:58,270
Come on, baby. Aw, Christ!

1382
02:01:58,343 --> 02:02:00,006
- Nothing.
- Breathe!

1383
02:02:01,026 --> 02:02:04,824
- I’ll jack it up to 300.
- Do it again, One Night. Zap her again.

1384
02:02:04,865 --> 02:02:07,307
It’s going, it’s going. It’s charging.

1385
02:02:07,927 --> 02:02:11,442
Charging. Charging. Charging.

1386
02:02:11,483 --> 02:02:12,803
- Now!
- Clear!

1387
02:02:14,675 --> 02:02:16,455
- Anything?
- No pulse.

1388
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:18,832
- Come on, baby.
- Just charging one more time.

1389
02:02:19,086 --> 02:02:20,421
Zap her again.

1390
02:02:20,706 --> 02:02:21,860
Come on!

1391
02:02:22,830 --> 02:02:24,804
- Come on!
- Clear!

1392
02:02:27,587 --> 02:02:29,132
God! No pulse.

1393
02:02:29,173 --> 02:02:31,654
Bud, it’s flat.
Goddamn, it’s flat.

1394
02:02:33,995 --> 02:02:37,235
One, two, three, four, five-one thousand.

1395
02:02:37,328 --> 02:02:40,336
One, two, three, four... breathe!

1396
02:02:40,385 --> 02:02:43,680
One, two, three, four... breathe!

1397
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:52,247
Breathe. Come on, baby.

1398
02:02:52,333 --> 02:02:54,032
1,000,
2,000,

1399
02:02:54,073 --> 02:02:56,393
3,000,
4,000...

1400
02:02:57,087 --> 02:02:59,214
Come on, baby.
1,000, 2,000,

1401
02:02:59,272 --> 02:03:01,613
3,000, 4,000, 5,000--

1402
02:03:01,654 --> 02:03:03,779
Come on, baby, breathe. Come on!

1403
02:03:03,832 --> 02:03:06,926
- 2,000, 3,000.
- Bud. Bud.

1404
02:03:07,219 --> 02:03:09,306
Bud? Bud.

1405
02:03:11,256 --> 02:03:12,886
It’s all over, man.

1406
02:03:15,553 --> 02:03:17,040
It’s all over.

1407
02:03:17,801 --> 02:03:19,236
I’m sorry.

1408
02:03:20,132 --> 02:03:21,757
No pulse.

1409
02:03:44,191 --> 02:03:45,651
No!

1410
02:03:45,891 --> 02:03:48,755
No! She has a strong heart!
She wants to live!

1411
02:03:48,802 --> 02:03:51,148
Come on, Lins!
Come on, baby!

1412
02:04:24,625 --> 02:04:25,817
Zap her again.

1413
02:04:25,937 --> 02:04:27,164
- Do it!
- Charging.

1414
02:04:27,213 --> 02:04:29,090
- Do it!
- Charging.

1415
02:04:34,832 --> 02:04:36,444
- Come on, baby.
- Clear.

1416
02:04:36,485 --> 02:04:37,665
Clear!

1417
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:41,940
Get back!

1418
02:04:49,257 --> 02:04:50,837
Come on, breathe, baby.

1419
02:04:51,051 --> 02:04:52,857
Goddamn it, breathe!

1420
02:04:52,929 --> 02:04:55,871
Goddamn it, you bitch, you never
backed away from anything in your life!

1421
02:04:55,914 --> 02:04:56,995
Now fight!

1422
02:04:57,041 --> 02:04:58,875
Fight! Fight!

1423
02:04:58,930 --> 02:05:00,972
Right now! Do it!

1424
02:05:01,355 --> 02:05:03,274
Fight, goddamn it!

1425
02:05:04,747 --> 02:05:08,250
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1426
02:05:08,467 --> 02:05:12,227
Fight!

1427
02:05:17,248 --> 02:05:19,508
Lins. That’s it, Lindsey.

1428
02:05:19,589 --> 02:05:21,248
That’s it, Lins. You can do it.

1429
02:05:21,461 --> 02:05:23,458
That’s it, Lins. Come on back, baby.

1430
02:05:23,531 --> 02:05:25,492
Come on, you can do it, baby.

1431
02:05:28,254 --> 02:05:29,452
Lindsey.

1432
02:05:36,695 --> 02:05:39,312
Get her some air.
Get her some air.

1433
02:05:39,372 --> 02:05:41,575
- Easy. Breathe easy.
- Look at that.

1434
02:05:41,655 --> 02:05:43,823
All right. All right.

1435
02:05:44,938 --> 02:05:47,256
You did it, ace! Huh?

1436
02:05:52,298 --> 02:05:54,007
Yeah! Yeah!

1437
02:05:57,071 --> 02:05:58,225
You did it, babe.

1438
02:05:58,459 --> 02:06:00,227
Easy. Breathe easy.

1439
02:06:01,078 --> 02:06:04,904
Watch her... Make sure--
make sure her heart’s doin’ okay.

1440
02:06:21,560 --> 02:06:23,977
Big boys don’t cry.
Remember?

1441
02:06:30,215 --> 02:06:32,301
Hi, lady.

1442
02:06:33,385 --> 02:06:35,063
Hi, tough guy.

1443
02:06:38,843 --> 02:06:42,305
- I guess it worked, didn’t it?
- Yeah, of course it did.

1444
02:06:44,271 --> 02:06:45,850
You’re never wrong, are you?

1445
02:06:48,942 --> 02:06:51,250
How you feelin’? Huh?

1446
02:06:51,891 --> 02:06:53,464
I’ve felt better.

1447
02:06:54,857 --> 02:06:56,797
What did you do to me?

1448
02:07:02,867 --> 02:07:04,774
Next time it’s your turn. Okay?

1449
02:07:05,494 --> 02:07:06,494
Yeah.

1450
02:07:08,037 --> 02:07:09,824
Yeah, you got that right.

1451
02:07:11,061 --> 02:07:14,114
Okay, these are so your eyes can focus
in the breathing fluid.

1452
02:07:14,551 --> 02:07:16,629
How’s that feel?
There it is.

1453
02:07:16,962 --> 02:07:19,285
If you can’t see,
you can’t disarm the bomb. Right?

1454
02:07:19,445 --> 02:07:22,847
Okay, with this much weight,
you’re gonna fall like a brick.

1455
02:07:23,936 --> 02:07:27,470
We still got about an hour,
so we should get there in plenty of time.

1456
02:07:28,170 --> 02:07:30,564
When you get down there,
all you gotta do is cut one wire,

1457
02:07:30,605 --> 02:07:32,859
drop the weights
and come on home.

1458
02:07:36,657 --> 02:07:39,517
- Hand me that wrench, will ya?
- Maybe I oughta check and see--

1459
02:07:39,995 --> 02:07:41,732
Yeah, that’s a good place.

1460
02:07:42,996 --> 02:07:46,166
This is loose.
I’ll fix that up.

1461
02:07:46,250 --> 02:07:47,255
Bud,

1462
02:07:47,501 --> 02:07:49,381
you don’t have to do this.

1463
02:07:50,448 --> 02:07:52,151
Somebody’s gotta do it.

1464
02:07:52,430 --> 02:07:54,291
It doesn’t have to be you.

1465
02:07:54,804 --> 02:07:56,608
Who, then?

1466
02:08:00,793 --> 02:08:03,006
So, what, I can...
hear you, but...

1467
02:08:03,512 --> 02:08:04,645
I can’t talk, right?

1468
02:08:04,686 --> 02:08:07,530
The fluid prevents the larynx
from making sound-- Excuse me.

1469
02:08:07,571 --> 02:08:09,891
- It’ll feel a little strange.
- Yeah, no shit.

1470
02:08:10,597 --> 02:08:14,420
I gotta warn you all...
I’m a pretty lousy typist.

1471
02:08:18,426 --> 02:08:20,200
The moment of truth.

1472
02:08:21,344 --> 02:08:22,899
- Come on. Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

1473
02:08:24,568 --> 02:08:25,595
Easy.

1474
02:08:25,981 --> 02:08:27,128
Okay.

1475
02:08:27,958 --> 02:08:30,786
I need it in the front a little bit.
Thank you.

1476
02:08:30,833 --> 02:08:31,975
Got it.

1477
02:08:33,655 --> 02:08:35,094
- Set.
- Set.

1478
02:08:35,172 --> 02:08:36,407
- Clamp.
- Set.

1479
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:48,883
Okay, let’s rock and roll.

1480
02:08:50,630 --> 02:08:51,874
Crack it.

1481
02:08:52,598 --> 02:08:54,535
Headset. Headset, please.

1482
02:08:56,452 --> 02:08:59,288
- Okay?
- Relax now, Bud. Just relax.

1483
02:09:00,142 --> 02:09:02,839
- Bud. Watch me.
- Relax now, Bud.

1484
02:09:03,546 --> 02:09:05,662
- Relax. It’s okay.
- Okay? Watch me.

1485
02:09:06,012 --> 02:09:07,966
Don’t hold your breath.
Take it in.

1486
02:09:08,007 --> 02:09:11,039
Just let yourself take it in.
Take it in.

1487
02:09:12,445 --> 02:09:13,895
- That’s it.
- Oh, man.

1488
02:09:13,936 --> 02:09:16,413
Don’t hold your breath, now.
Take it in. There you go.

1489
02:09:16,506 --> 02:09:17,706
Don’t hold your breath.

1490
02:09:17,792 --> 02:09:19,619
Take it in. That’s it.
There you go.

1491
02:09:20,161 --> 02:09:23,329
- Bud! This is not normal!
- Hold him! Hold him!

1492
02:09:23,764 --> 02:09:26,550
This is normal. It’ll pass in a second.
It’s perfectly normal.

1493
02:09:26,936 --> 02:09:29,036
- This is normal?
- It’s perfectly normal.

1494
02:09:29,582 --> 02:09:32,739
We all breathed liquid for nine months, Bud.
Your body will remember.

1495
02:09:32,826 --> 02:09:35,326
That’s it. That’s it.

1496
02:09:36,235 --> 02:09:39,302
- Perfectly normal.
- Christ, he’s breathin’ it.

1497
02:09:39,369 --> 02:09:40,647
Give me that.

1498
02:09:42,074 --> 02:09:43,321
Can you hear me?

1499
02:09:43,867 --> 02:09:45,723
- There he goes. He’s got it.
- Yes.

1500
02:09:45,764 --> 02:09:47,329
- Okay, Bud.
- That’s it.

1501
02:09:47,907 --> 02:09:49,354
Try your keypad.

1502
02:10:00,946 --> 02:10:02,184
Right.

1503
02:10:04,767 --> 02:10:06,644
I already have.

1504
02:10:09,870 --> 02:10:11,674
- Okay. Let’s go.
- Great.

1505
02:10:12,667 --> 02:10:14,989
- Okay.
- That’s okay. I got it.

1506
02:10:16,293 --> 02:10:17,293
I got it.

1507
02:10:18,830 --> 02:10:21,301
- Okay, Hippy, you got that?
- Hold on, Jammer.

1508
02:10:21,342 --> 02:10:23,574
- Okay, Bud.
- Easy. Easy.

1509
02:10:23,656 --> 02:10:26,577
Watch out. Watch his side.
Watch the back.

1510
02:10:27,681 --> 02:10:29,029
Careful.

1511
02:10:31,207 --> 02:10:35,461
I rigged in Little Geek’s chip
the same as Big Geek.

1512
02:10:35,525 --> 02:10:37,454
It should take you straight there.

1513
02:10:37,567 --> 02:10:40,662
All you have to do is hang on.

1514
02:12:26,954 --> 02:12:29,658
- What’s his depth?
- 3,200 feet.

1515
02:12:29,861 --> 02:12:31,540
Your depth is 3,200 feet.

1516
02:12:31,667 --> 02:12:33,074
<i>You’re doing fine.</i>

1517
02:12:33,427 --> 02:12:37,207
<i>You’d better watch out for crane wreckage.
You should be almost to it.</i>

1518
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:51,510
- 4,800 feet. It’s official.
- Yeah.

1519
02:12:52,157 --> 02:12:56,319
Bud, according to Monk here, you just
set a record for the deepest suit dive.

1520
02:12:56,903 --> 02:12:59,998
<i>Bet you didn’t think you’d be doing this
when you got up this morning, huh?</i>

1521
02:13:09,043 --> 02:13:11,485
One mile down. Still grinnin’.

1522
02:13:27,711 --> 02:13:29,438
8,500 feet.

1523
02:13:31,751 --> 02:13:33,188
8,500 feet, Bud.

1524
02:13:33,314 --> 02:13:34,665
<i>Everything okay?</i>

1525
02:13:37,211 --> 02:13:40,651
Ask him about pressure effects.
Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.

1526
02:13:43,177 --> 02:13:45,469
Ensign Monk wants to know
how you feel.

1527
02:13:57,367 --> 02:13:59,781
It’s starting.
It hits the nervous system first.

1528
02:14:00,266 --> 02:14:02,794
Keep talking Lindsey.
Let him hear your voice.

1529
02:14:02,966 --> 02:14:05,118
Okay, Bud, your depth is 8,900 feet.

1530
02:14:05,159 --> 02:14:08,318
- You’re doing fine.
- No, Lindsey.

1531
02:14:08,957 --> 02:14:10,959
Talk to him.

1532
02:14:17,697 --> 02:14:18,851
Bud.

1533
02:14:20,135 --> 02:14:21,431
There are some...

1534
02:14:21,964 --> 02:14:23,882
some things I need to say.

1535
02:14:25,401 --> 02:14:27,167
It’s hard for me, you know.

1536
02:14:28,986 --> 02:14:31,736
It’s not easy
being a cast-iron bitch.

1537
02:14:32,047 --> 02:14:34,925
Takes discipline
and years of training.

1538
02:14:36,405 --> 02:14:38,324
A lot of people don’t appreciate that.

1539
02:14:41,781 --> 02:14:45,041
<i>Jesus, I’m sorry I can’t
tell you these things to your face.</i>

1540
02:14:45,854 --> 02:14:48,012
I have to wait till
you’re alone in the dark,

1541
02:14:49,177 --> 02:14:52,537
<i>freezing, and there’s
10,000 feet of water between us.</i>

1542
02:14:54,210 --> 02:14:55,979
I’m sorry. I’m rambling.

1543
02:15:09,876 --> 02:15:11,962
Comin’ up on the big ten thou.

1544
02:15:19,301 --> 02:15:20,613
12,000 feet. Jesus!

1545
02:15:20,654 --> 02:15:22,647
- I don’t believe he’s doin’ this!
- Hippy!

1546
02:15:23,347 --> 02:15:25,094
Shut up! What’s wrong with you?

1547
02:15:29,583 --> 02:15:31,265
Bud, how are you doing?

1548
02:15:33,655 --> 02:15:34,742
Signal’s fading.

1549
02:15:34,802 --> 02:15:37,628
No. No, Bud,
I’m not going away. I’m right here.

1550
02:15:37,742 --> 02:15:41,894
Kill everything we don’t need. Catfish,
knock out those exterior lights. Now! Go!

1551
02:15:41,947 --> 02:15:45,729
Run it through the digital processor.
Cook it as much as you can.

1552
02:15:45,827 --> 02:15:47,837
I am right here with you, Bud.

1553
02:15:48,297 --> 02:15:49,670
Bud, this is Lindsey.

1554
02:15:50,090 --> 02:15:51,210
<i>Please.</i>

1555
02:15:51,338 --> 02:15:52,863
<i>I’m right here with you.</i>

1556
02:15:53,184 --> 02:15:57,203
<i>Okay? So, try and stay calm.
I’m right here. All right?</i>

1557
02:16:03,351 --> 02:16:04,644
Bud?

1558
02:16:07,262 --> 02:16:09,422
He’s losing it.
Talk to him.

1559
02:16:09,609 --> 02:16:12,273
- Keep him with us.
- Coming up on 16,000.

1560
02:16:12,314 --> 02:16:14,542
Bud, it’s the pressure.
All right?

1561
02:16:14,619 --> 02:16:17,872
You have to listen to my voice.
You have to try. Concentrate.

1562
02:16:17,975 --> 02:16:21,424
<i>All right?
Just listen to my voice. Please.</i>

1563
02:16:21,822 --> 02:16:23,699
17,000 feet.

1564
02:16:24,179 --> 02:16:26,532
Christ Almighty,
this is insane.

1565
02:16:26,852 --> 02:16:29,535
Bud, I’m not getting anything.

1566
02:16:35,007 --> 02:16:37,090
- Whoa, whoa-- Oh, come on. No.
- What?

1567
02:16:37,131 --> 02:16:40,194
- Little Geek just folded.
- Oh, Jesus.

1568
02:17:30,580 --> 02:17:32,778
He can still make it.

1569
02:17:37,794 --> 02:17:39,016
Bud,

1570
02:17:40,375 --> 02:17:42,424
I know how alone you feel.

1571
02:17:44,380 --> 02:17:45,720
Alone in all that...

1572
02:17:45,869 --> 02:17:46,767
cold...

1573
02:17:46,826 --> 02:17:47,967
blackness.

1574
02:17:51,743 --> 02:17:53,969
<i>But, I’m there in the dark with you.</i>

1575
02:17:54,252 --> 02:17:56,171
<i>Oh, Bud, you’re not alone.</i>

1576
02:18:00,642 --> 02:18:01,995
Oh, God.

1577
02:18:02,709 --> 02:18:04,616
Do you remember that time...

1578
02:18:04,689 --> 02:18:07,999
You were pretty drunk.
You probably don’t remember.

1579
02:18:08,479 --> 02:18:13,085
<i>But the power went out in that
little apartment we had on Orange Street.</i>

1580
02:18:13,497 --> 02:18:18,464
We were staring at that one little candle
and I said something really dumb, like,

1581
02:18:18,971 --> 02:18:21,417
“That candle is me,” like...

1582
02:18:22,037 --> 02:18:26,825
like every one of us is out there
alone in the dark in this life.

1583
02:18:28,475 --> 02:18:29,761
And you just...

1584
02:18:30,228 --> 02:18:33,065
you just lit up another candle
and put it beside mine...

1585
02:18:33,106 --> 02:18:36,026
and you said, “No. See, that’s me.
That’s me.”

1586
02:18:37,938 --> 02:18:40,438
We stared at the two candles, and then...

1587
02:18:43,448 --> 02:18:47,237
Well, if you remember any of this,
I’m sure you remember the next part.

1588
02:18:50,999 --> 02:18:53,649
But there are two candles in the dark.

1589
02:18:55,427 --> 02:18:56,666
I’m with you.

1590
02:18:57,767 --> 02:19:00,807
I’ll always be with you, Bud.
I promise that.

1591
02:19:14,397 --> 02:19:15,997
How you doin’, podner?

1592
02:19:17,503 --> 02:19:19,550
You still with us?
Come back.

1593
02:19:20,611 --> 02:19:23,002
You talk to us, Buddy boy.

1594
02:19:23,082 --> 02:19:25,142
- Come on.
- Bud.

1595
02:19:25,647 --> 02:19:26,647
Bud?

1596
02:19:27,035 --> 02:19:28,781
Now, come on.
You hangin’ in there?

1597
02:19:29,777 --> 02:19:32,655
You have to talk to me, Bud. Please.

1598
02:19:32,886 --> 02:19:34,525
I need to know if you’re okay.

1599
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:51,584
You see--
You see a light?

1600
02:19:51,901 --> 02:19:53,506
What kind of light, Bud?

1601
02:19:55,718 --> 02:19:57,644
He’s hallucinating badly.

1602
02:20:20,661 --> 02:20:22,975
- He made it.
- Oh, my God.

1603
02:20:23,144 --> 02:20:24,148
Oh, man.

1604
02:20:26,473 --> 02:20:29,893
Okay, Bud,
we’ll go step by step.

1605
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:33,010
<i>Remove the detonator housing</i>

1606
02:20:33,250 --> 02:20:36,490
<i>by unscrewing it counterclockwise.</i>

1607
02:21:07,184 --> 02:21:08,453
<i>All right, Bud,</i>

1608
02:21:09,247 --> 02:21:11,207
<i>you have to cut the ground wire,</i>

1609
02:21:11,326 --> 02:21:13,174
not the lead wire.

1610
02:21:13,874 --> 02:21:16,185
It’s the blue wire
with the white stripe.

1611
02:21:16,327 --> 02:21:18,527
<i>Not, I repeat,</i>

1612
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:22,040
<i>not the black wire
with the yellow stripe.</i>

1613
02:22:18,386 --> 02:22:21,206
- Yes!
- Quiet! Quiet. Save your air.

1614
02:22:21,311 --> 02:22:24,010
Bud, give me a reading
off your liquid oxygen gauge.

1615
02:22:31,750 --> 02:22:33,079
What?

1616
02:22:34,044 --> 02:22:37,591
- Took him 30 minutes just to get down there!
- Bud, do you hear me?

1617
02:22:37,684 --> 02:22:39,850
You drop your weights
and start back now, Bud!

1618
02:22:39,970 --> 02:22:41,670
<i>That gauge could be wrong!</i>

1619
02:22:41,771 --> 02:22:45,608
<i>Do you hear me?
Just drop your weights and start back now.</i>

1620
02:22:45,690 --> 02:22:49,050
<i>Your gauge could be wrong!
Your gauge could be wrong!</i>

1621
02:22:49,091 --> 02:22:51,947
<i>You drop your weights
and start back now!</i>

1622
02:22:55,450 --> 02:22:58,231
No, you won’t stay there!
Do you hear me? You drop your weights.

1623
02:22:58,291 --> 02:23:00,932
You can breathe shallow!
Do you hear me?

1624
02:23:01,059 --> 02:23:03,921
Bud, please! Listen to me,
please! Goddamn it!

1625
02:23:03,962 --> 02:23:09,054
You dragged me back from the bottomless pit!
You can’t leave me here alone now! Please.

1626
02:23:10,107 --> 02:23:12,634
Oh, God, Virgil, please.

1627
02:23:12,892 --> 02:23:14,385
<i>Please.</i>

1628
02:23:55,636 --> 02:23:57,303
I love you.

1629
02:29:03,574 --> 02:29:04,905
Howdy.

1630
02:29:07,346 --> 02:29:09,116
How you guys doin’?

1631
02:29:13,994 --> 02:29:18,505
<i>...attempts to convene a summit
between heads of state have collapsed--</i>

1632
02:29:18,546 --> 02:29:21,632
<i>Soviet buildup of tanks and aircraft have--</i>

1633

<i>All citizens to stay on their jobs,
restrict unnecessary travel--</i>

1634
02:29:26,323 --> 02:29:30,034
<i>- We had moments ago an unprovoked attack...</i>
- Holy shit.

1635
02:29:30,121 --> 02:29:33,270
<i>Across the country, National Guard units
have been mobilized,</i>

1636
02:29:33,311 --> 02:29:37,364
<i>and also defense volunteer staff
have been called to full-time duty.</i>

1637
02:29:40,143 --> 02:29:42,790
You watch our TV.
That’s what you’re tellin’ me...

1638
02:29:43,459 --> 02:29:44,995
that you know
what’s goin’ on up there?

1639
02:29:45,036 --> 02:29:48,417
<i>Seismologists worldwide are reporting
an enormous disturbance...</i>

1640
02:29:48,458 --> 02:29:52,664
<i>throughout the world’s oceans
which apparently began about 15 minutes ago.</i>

1641
02:29:52,705 --> 02:29:57,747
<i>They are acoustic shock waves, like tsunamis,
but with no apparent seismological source.</i>

1642
02:29:57,880 --> 02:30:01,827
<i>The waves are propagating toward
the shorelines of every continent.</i>

1643
02:30:01,868 --> 02:30:03,943
<i>Dr. Berg, would you please,
based on the--</i>

1644
02:30:03,997 --> 02:30:08,260
<i>Young lady. Young lady, listen to me.
We don’t know what’s going on yet.</i>

1645
02:30:08,301 --> 02:30:09,770
<i>We don’t have a clue.</i>

1646
02:30:12,054 --> 02:30:13,860
<i>The horizon has already grown dark.</i>

1647
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:17,170
<i>People are running everywhere.
It’s... it’s sheer panic.</i>

1648
02:30:17,257 --> 02:30:18,437
<i>Stay on me!</i>

1649
02:30:18,843 --> 02:30:23,058
<i>The wave-- The wave is, I don’t know,
maybe 1,000 feet high already.</i>

1650
02:30:23,130 --> 02:30:24,597
<i>Getting bigger
as I’m watching.</i>

1651
02:30:24,657 --> 02:30:26,189
<i>Still miles out.</i>

1652
02:30:27,702 --> 02:30:28,643
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1653
02:30:28,684 --> 02:30:30,819
<i>- Get outta here!
- We’re staying!</i>

1654
02:30:31,337 --> 02:30:35,046
<i>Give it to me, then!
I don’t even know if I’m still broadcasting.</i>

1655
02:30:35,087 --> 02:30:38,577
<i>I can’t be sure.
I’ll just keep going as long as I can.</i>

1656
02:30:39,022 --> 02:30:41,784
<i>- Get out of the way!
- A thousand--</i>

1657
02:30:43,455 --> 02:30:45,426
You guys are doing this.

1658
02:30:47,665 --> 02:30:50,786
You guys are doing this, right?
You can control water.

1659
02:30:51,471 --> 02:30:54,539
That’s your technology.
But why are you doin’ this?

1660
02:31:11,988 --> 02:31:13,180
Okay.

1661
02:31:14,645 --> 02:31:16,900
Okay, that’s enough.
I get the point!

1662
02:31:19,082 --> 02:31:20,560
How do you know...

1663
02:31:21,089 --> 02:31:23,149
they’re really gonna do it?

1664
02:31:24,703 --> 02:31:28,839
Where do you get off passin’ judgment on us?
You can’t be sure.

1665
02:31:29,248 --> 02:31:31,008
How do you know?

1666
02:34:25,509 --> 02:34:27,226
You could have done it.

1667
02:34:31,355 --> 02:34:32,928
Why didn’t you?

1668
02:35:51,222 --> 02:35:54,517
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

1669
02:35:54,713 --> 02:35:56,806
Do you hear, Deepcore?

1670
02:35:57,226 --> 02:36:00,579
Deepcore, do you read?
Do you read me, Deepcore?

1671
02:36:03,322 --> 02:36:06,041
<i>Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.</i>

1672
02:36:08,688 --> 02:36:10,853
Hell, yes, we read.
Good of you to join us.

1673
02:36:10,926 --> 02:36:15,417
- Copy, Deepcore. Hey, I’ve got ’em!
<i>- How’s that storm up there?</i>

1674
02:36:15,501 --> 02:36:18,478
Well, it’s strange. It just sort of
blew itself out all of a sudden.

1675
02:36:18,676 --> 02:36:20,883
Hell, son, you better get
a line down to us.

1676
02:36:20,924 --> 02:36:23,108
We’re in moderately
poor shape down here.

1677
02:36:23,201 --> 02:36:25,961
We lost seven people,
includin’ Bud.

1678
02:36:26,068 --> 02:36:27,344
<i>And we’re
about out of O₂,</i>

1679
02:36:27,385 --> 02:36:29,392
so whatever you’re gonna do,
you better do it fast.

1680
02:36:31,946 --> 02:36:34,396
<i>You boys make up your mind
how to get us out of here yet?</i>

1681
02:36:34,444 --> 02:36:37,195
They’re talking about flying in a DSRV
from Norfolk.

1682
02:36:37,248 --> 02:36:41,420
- Just wish I could’ve seen it.
- Okay, how long is that gonna take?

1683
02:36:41,473 --> 02:36:45,207
How do you stop
a half-mile high tidal wave in--

1684
02:36:49,508 --> 02:36:50,508
Hey.

1685
02:36:50,948 --> 02:36:53,162
Hey. Hey, it’s Bud!

1686
02:36:53,881 --> 02:36:55,762
That’s impossible.

1687
02:36:57,257 --> 02:36:58,585
No, it’s not.

1688
02:36:58,990 --> 02:37:02,116
<i>- Do you hear, Deepcore? Do you read?</i>
- Yes!

1689
02:37:02,696 --> 02:37:05,206
Wait. Wait. Wait.
We’ve got a message from Bud.

1690
02:37:05,326 --> 02:37:07,899
- Bud?
- What’s it say?

1691
02:37:08,966 --> 02:37:10,305
Here.

1692
02:37:12,256 --> 02:37:14,643
It says “Virgil Brigman back on the air.”

1693
02:37:15,282 --> 02:37:17,743
<i>Yes!</i>

1694
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:28,537
“Have some... new friends down here.”

1695
02:37:29,039 --> 02:37:31,238
<i>“Guess they’ve been here a while.”</i>

1696
02:37:40,704 --> 02:37:44,817
“They’ve left us alone, but it bothers them
to see us hurting each other.”

1697
02:37:48,861 --> 02:37:50,468
“Getting out of hand.”

1698
02:37:58,963 --> 02:38:01,674
“They sent a message.
Hope you got it.”

1699
02:38:02,286 --> 02:38:05,280
I’d say that’s a big 10-4, Jack.

1700
02:38:06,428 --> 02:38:08,067
<i>“They want us
to grow up a bit</i>

1701
02:38:08,140 --> 02:38:10,189
“and put away childish things.”

1702
02:38:12,596 --> 02:38:15,662
”Of course,
it’s just a suggestion.”

1703
02:38:24,162 --> 02:38:26,948
Looks like you boys
might be out of business.

1704
02:38:37,229 --> 02:38:39,023
What the hell’s goin’ on?

1705
02:38:39,326 --> 02:38:42,946
- One Night, get to sonar.
- Good God Almighty.

1706
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:45,902
Fellas,

1707
02:38:46,448 --> 02:38:48,475
I’m gettin’ some
awful big readings here.

1708
02:38:48,548 --> 02:38:50,745
- Something’s coming up the wall.
- What is it?

1709
02:38:50,786 --> 02:38:52,827
Whatever it is, it’s major!

1710
02:39:24,717 --> 02:39:27,510
Something’s definitely
going on down there.

1711
02:39:28,660 --> 02:39:32,193
Active is pinging back something really big.
It’s huge.

1712
02:39:32,234 --> 02:39:34,587
- And it’s coming up right underneath us.
- Where?

1713
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:38,344
Where? It’s everywhere.
There! Starboard bow.

1714
02:39:42,966 --> 02:39:44,968
This is the Benthic Explorer.

1715
02:41:01,156 --> 02:41:03,450
There! Look!
Look!

1716
02:41:16,364 --> 02:41:18,282
Help, Cat.

1717
02:41:48,699 --> 02:41:50,440
We should be dead.

1718
02:41:50,606 --> 02:41:52,506
We didn’t decompress.

1719
02:41:54,712 --> 02:41:57,548
They must’ve done something to us.

1720
02:41:58,852 --> 02:42:00,065
Oh, yeah.

1721
02:42:01,266 --> 02:42:03,832
Yeah, I think you could say that.

1722
02:42:53,006 --> 02:42:54,925
Hi, Brigman.

1723
02:42:56,157 --> 02:42:58,237
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
