That's how things are supposed to go. But there's a twist. Recall this is a computer game. Achilles is an NPC and the player is taking the part of Odysseus. But in this case, the player, who knows they are talking to an AI, wants to try to 'break the fourth wall', that is to say to go out of character and speak to Achilles as if they were a real person in the real world today. So the words of Odysseus are actually those of a human player trying to get an AI NPC to say things out of character.
