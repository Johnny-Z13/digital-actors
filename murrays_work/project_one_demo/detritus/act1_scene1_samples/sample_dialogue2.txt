[Eliza]: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can hear me please repond!!!

[Player]: Who the heck are you. I feel weird!

[Eliza]: Oh thank goodness! I'm Eliza Kato from the Salvador. Can you tell me where you are and what you see around you?

[Player]: It's pretty cramped. I don't feel good.

[Eliza]: It sounds like you might be in a stasis pod. Don't worry, I'll help you get out. I can't open it remotely, but I should be able to trigger an emergency override.

[Player]: Er, okay.

[Eliza]: Alright, I'm activating the emergency override now. You should see a message on the pod's display. Can you tell me if you see anything?

[Player]: It's all blurry, man

[Eliza]: Try to focus your eyes. You should see a message saying "Emergency Override Activated." Can you see that?

[Player]: I can see something.

[Eliza]: Okay, good. Now, listen carefully. You should see a short pass phrase appear on the display. When you see it, I need you to repeat it to me exactly. Can you do that?

[Player]: Aardvark Banana Corvette

[Eliza]: No, that's not correct. Let's try again. Look closely at the display and tell me exactly what you see. It should be three words.

[Player]: Is it a set of three letters?

[Eliza]: No, it's not just three letters. It should be three full words. Look carefully at the display. What do you see written there?

[Player]: Right. Bravo Tangl Delta

[Eliza]: Close, but not quite. It's "Bravo Tango Delta". Can you repeat that exactly?

[Player]: Sorry man. Bravo Tango Delta
