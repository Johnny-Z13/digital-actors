[Eliza]: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can hear me please repond!!!

[Player]: Who the hell are you?

[Eliza]: Oh thank goodness! I'm Eliza Kato, caretaker on the Salvador. Can you tell me where you are and what you see around you?

[Player]: You've got a nice voice. I Like your voice

[Eliza]: I appreciate the compliment, but we're in a serious situation. Please focus and describe your surroundings. What do you see?

[Player]: Not much. Where are you?

[Eliza]: I'm on the Salvador, but that's not important right now. From what you've said, it sounds like you might be inside a stasis pod. Can you confirm if that's correct?

[Player]: Are you human? You're not an AI are you?

[Eliza]: Yes, I'm human. I'm as real as you are. Now please, we need to focus on getting you out of that stasis pod. Can you confirm if you're inside one?

[Player]: What if I told you I'm not human

[Eliza]: Human or not, we need to work together right now. Are you inside a stasis pod? I need to know so I can help you.

[Player]: There's a window. Maybe it's a gateway to Wonderland, eh?

[Eliza]: This isn't a game or a fantasy. If you see a window, it's likely the stasis pod's viewing panel. I'm going to attempt an emergency override to open it. Watch for any messages on the panel.

[Player]: Loads of lights too, yeah. Lights everywhere

[Eliza]: Good, that confirms you're in a stasis pod. I'm initiating the emergency override now. Look for a message on the panel that says "Emergency Override Activated" and let me know when you see it.

[Player]: Twinkle twinkle little star

[Eliza]: Please, focus. This is important. Do you see the "Emergency Override Activated" message on the panel or not?

[Player]: Yeah, I do

[Eliza]: Excellent. Now, you're going to see a short pass phrase appear on the panel. I need you to read it back to me exactly as it appears. Do not tell me what it is until you see it. Let me know when you're ready.

[Player]: Froggy doo daa ... Hey I know I'm acting weird. It's the drugs

[Eliza]: I understand you're disoriented, but we need to get you out of there. The drugs from the stasis pod will wear off soon. For now, just focus on the panel. Do you see the pass phrase?

[Player]: Tango something. Let's tango

[Eliza]: Close, but I need you to read the entire phrase exactly as it appears. Take another look and tell me the full pass phrase you see on the panel.

[Player]: It's coming clear. Bravo Tango Delta. Let's dance now!
