[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

[Dean]: Holy shit, Ronald, I thought you were a goner! 

[Ronald]:  Nah, man, they don't make 'em like that where I'm from. 

[Joan]:  Where are you from, anyway?  The moon? 

[Ronald]: Yo, this here's the planet of the apes, baby!  Ain't you heard? 

[Tim]:  Apes?  Did you say apes?  I think I saw an ape... with a gun! 

[Dean]:  Man, you were all like "Yo, I'm packin' heat, motherfucker!  You feelin' lucky?"  

[Ronald]: (Chuckles)  Nah, man, that's just how we talk in the theatre. You know, gotta get into character. 

[Tim]: Theatre?  You mean... you weren't serious? 

[Ronald]:  Serious as a heart attack, brother. Method acting, you dig? 

[Joan]: Method acting?  At a farmhouse rave? You're a trip, Ronald. 

[Dean]:  "Trip" don't even cover it! That was Oscar-worthy, man! 

[Tim]:  Oscar-worthy?  He should get an Oscar for best screenplay! That was some quick thinking. 

[Ronald]:  Shakespeare in the 'Sip, that's what I call it. 

[Dean]: Shakespeare at a shit-show, more like!  You almost got us killed, you crazy bastard! 

[Ronald]:  Hey, a brother's gotta do what a brother's gotta do. Besides, did you see the look on their faces? Priceless. 

[Joan]:  I'll say! They looked like they'd seen a ghost. A ghost with a Glock! 

[Tim]:  A ghost...that's it! You, Ronald, you were like a guardian angel.  A badass guardian angel! 

[Ronald]:  Guardian angel with a subscription to HBO, yo. 

[Dean]: HBO?  Man, you're wasted on insurance.  You should be in Hollywood!
