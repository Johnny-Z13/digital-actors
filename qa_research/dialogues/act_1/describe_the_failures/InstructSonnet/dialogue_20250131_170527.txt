Eliza: Shit! The error is spreading like wildfire! These signals are off the charts! I need a full description of what is happening in the room NOW!
Player: The whole place is going haywire! There's a flashing red light, a loud klaxon, and I can see fires breaking out around some of the stasis pods. Oh, and the droids are falling out of the sky like dead flies!
Eliza: Fuck! This is a full-scale system failure. We're looking at a cascade effect. Listen carefully, we need to abandon the engineer and get you to the control room immediately. Can you see a clear path to get there?
