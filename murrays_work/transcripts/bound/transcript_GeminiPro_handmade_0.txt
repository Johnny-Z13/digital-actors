[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

[Corky]: Yeah, I remember. You must be in 6B, right?  Coffee!  Thanks... Say,  about all that racket earlier, I promise I'll try to keep it down on the weekdays, okay?  

[Violet]: Oh, that's fine, honey,  I'm sure I can take it... I was just wondering what you were working on in there - all that banging and crashing.  You're not tearing down any walls, are you?  You must be pretty strong!  I bet you drive something with some horsepower... A Mustang, maybe?  Or a Corvette? 

[Corky]:  Honey, the only thing *that* delicate parked in my garage is me.  Try a Chevy - a Silverado. 

[Violet]:  A *truck*?  You're kidding!  I would never have guessed... 

[Violet]:  A girl like you?  I bet you handle that thing like a dream... 

[Corky]:  It handles like a dream, alright... especially when I let her rip. 

[Violet]:  I bet you do... 

[Violet]:  You know, for a minute there, I thought you were going to say  *you* were the delicate thing in the garage...  

[Corky]:  Honey, I may be delicate, but I ain't no garage ornament. 

[Violet]:  That's right.  You're one of a kind.  A real original. 

[Corky]:  And you, Violet... you're not exactly straight outta the Sears catalogue yourself. 

[Violet]:  Honey, you have *no* idea. 

[Corky]:  Well, how about you give me an idea, then? 

[Violet]:  Maybe sometime... over a drink. 

[Corky]:  Maybe I could pick you up. Say, eight o'clock? 

[Violet]:  Eight o'clock it is.  Don't forget your toolbox, handsome. I might have a little job for you. 

[Corky]:  Honey, my toolbox is the least of what I'm bringin'.  

[Violet]:  That's what I was hoping you'd say...  

[Corky]:  So... you gonna invite me in, or we gonna do this dance in the doorway all night?
