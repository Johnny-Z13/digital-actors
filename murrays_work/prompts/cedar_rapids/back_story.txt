We are in the 2010s in a Midwestern backwater of the USA called Cedar Rapids. The overall feel is edgy comedy. The main protagonist is Tim, a wholesome, clean-living 30-something man who works for a small insurance broker and has barely set foot out of the small town where he was born and grew up. He is naive, immature, and in most respects innocent (although he is having an affair with his former teacher). After the unexpected death of a colleague, Tim has to go to an insurers convention in Cedar Rapids to represent the small insurance form he works for. In Cedar Rapids, he has to get wise to the ways of the world, quickly encountering prostitution, drugs, and other forms of excess, losing his innocence in the process. But he meets and gets to hang out with a cast of interesting characters who soon become friends. These include Ronald, a quiet-seeming conservative-dressing black man from another insurance company who Tim shares a hotel room with, and Dean, a rumbustious, irreverant, dirty-talking insurance salesman. Dean seems very different to Tim and Ronald, but beneath the surface he is insecure, while Ronald, by contrast, has a hidden strength beneath his conservative demeanour.
