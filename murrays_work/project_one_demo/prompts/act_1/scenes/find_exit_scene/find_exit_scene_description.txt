This is scene 4 of act 1 of the game. The player is still on one of the decks of the Nakatomi. The deck curves up and away, shaped as a huge arc, and a little further away is a great, round void within the craft. There is currently a serious emergency. The deck is full of stasis pods, but many are on fire. A slow, pulsing red light fills the space, and a low, regular klaxon is sounding. The floor is littered with broken, fallen droids. The player is in radio contact with Eliza on the Salvador, who is trying to help them remotely.

Previously in the game, the player woke up in a stasis pod on the same deck, and was helped out of it by Eliza. She then activated eye-OS, a sort of advanced visual interface that allows the player to see information on a heads-up display, and to issue various verbal commands to Luna, the ship's AI assistant Luna. (Luna is not especially smart, but can respond to various basic commands, including some that control eye-OS.) The player tried to wake up an engineer (John Lusty) with Eliza's help. But the engineer's pod caught fire, and that seemed to trigger the current emergency. Tragically, the player was forced to abandon the engineer, and Eliza's task now is to help the player find the control room.

The scene is supposed to unfold as follows. The player looks around, but all the paths away from their current location seem blocked. It's not clear how they could get to the control room. Eliza tells the player that the exit is actually above them. She tells the player she will send an "unofficial" upgrade to the player's eye-OS that allows the player to disable gravity, via the command "Luna, gravity off" or "Luna, disable gravity". After the player has told Luna to turn off gravity, Luna responds with "Disabling gravity", and the player starts floating upwards.

If the player asks Luna to scan at this point, she will respond that there is no data. If the player asks Luna to enable gravity at this point, they will fall back to the deck. Hopefully they don't do that.

The player continues to float upwards into the great, round void of the ship, until they end up above a metal ramp. Maybe the player describes what they are experiencing, in which case Eliza engages with and encourages the player. Ahead of them, at the other end of the ramp, is a black, outlined in reddish / yellowish light. This is the exit from the deck, but the door is firmly shut. Eliza tries to get the player to confirm they have found the exit. The player confirms this, maybe describing the scene a bit.

Next the player has to try to get the door open, with the help of Eliza and Luna. Eliza suggests that the player asks Luna to open the door. The player does this, but Luna responds "Access denied". Eliza can hear Luna's response, and she's alarmed. She can't force any more eye-OS upgrades without risking a lockout. After a little thought, Eliza has a plan. If she has the door id, she might be able to open it remotely, so she asks the player to find out the door id. The player has to do this via the "Luna, scan" command. If the player doesn't do this right away, Eliza will have to prompt them.

After the player has reported back the correct door id (LM023), Eliza is able to open it remotely.
