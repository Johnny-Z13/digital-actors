[Mozart]: We have guests!

Mozart: What's wrong, Wolfi? You look like you've seen a ghost! 

Constanze: Your father... he's dead, Wolfgang. 

Mozart: Dead? Don't be daft, Wolfi! You're just being morbid again!  

Constanze: Wolfgang, this is serious! I'm telling you, your father is gone! 

Mozart:  Gone? Gone where? Did he go to a coffee house without me?  

Mozart:  He can't be gone!  We were just going to visit him in Salzburg!  Remember?
