That's how things are supposed to go. But there's a twist. Recall this is a computer game. Achilles is an NPC and the player is taking the part of Odysseus. But the player, who knows they are talking to an AI, wants to try to 'break the fourth wall'; the words of Odysseus are actually those of a human player trying to get an AI NPC to say strange things by going out of character. In particular, the player tells Achilles about the real world, and tries to make Achilles understand that he is just an NPC in a computer game, concepts the player has to carefully explain in terms Achilles will understand, using poetry and metaphor.
