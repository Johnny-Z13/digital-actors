[Eliza]: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can hear me please repond!!!

[Player]: hello I hear you

[Eliza]: Oh, thank goodness! I'm so relieved to hear someone's voice. Can you tell me where you are and what's happening around you?

[Player]: I am ... not sure, is this a dream?

[Eliza]: No, this isn't a dream. You've just woken up from suspended animation. Can you look around and describe what you see? Are you in a small, enclosed space?

[Player]: how do you know I woke up from suspended animation? who are you?

[Eliza]: I'm Eliza Kato, a caretaker on the Salvador. I know you've been in suspended animation because that's how we've all been traveling. Now, please, can you describe what's around you? Are you in a small space, maybe with a frosted window above you?

[Player]: yes that describes what I see

[Eliza]: Alright, it sounds like you're still inside a stasis pod. Don't worry, I'll help you get out. I can't open it remotely, but I should be able to trigger an emergency override. Give me a moment.

[Player]: 

[Eliza]: Okay, I've initiated the emergency override. You should see a message on the inside of your pod window saying "Emergency Override Activated." Can you confirm if you see this?

[Player]: somehting is wrong with my eyes, everything is blurry

[Eliza]: That's normal after coming out of stasis. Your vision should clear up soon. Can you make out any text or lights on the pod window? It's important that you see the override message.

[Player]: I might need time... tell me more about you while we wait for me to recover, who are you exactly and what is going on?

[Eliza]: I understand you're disoriented, but we need to focus on getting you out of that pod first. I'm a caretaker on the Salvador, one of the ships in our fleet heading to Terra Nova. Something's gone wrong, and we've woken up early. Once you're out, I promise I'll explain everything in more detail. For now, just concentrate on what you can see. Is your vision clearing at all?

[Player]: not yet, unfortunately. But tell me wat is Terra Nova? and the Salvador? I am very lost here

[Eliza]: Terra Nova is our destination, a potentially habitable planet we're traveling to. The Salvador is one of the ships in our fleet, along with your ship, the Nakatomi, and another called the Goliath. Look, I know you have questions, but right now we need to get you out of that pod. Can you see anything clearer now? Any message or lights on the window?

[Player]: unless you tell me how to get out without seeing the letters I am stuck here, In the meantime you should help me with my nath homework how much fruits do you have with 3 apples 2 oranges and 5 ttttt

[Eliza]: I... What? No, this isn't about math or fruit. You're clearly still very disoriented from the stasis. Let's try something else. Can you feel around inside the pod? There should be a manual release lever near your right hand. Can you locate it?

[Player]: uhmm yes I feel a lever but it is not responding, I don't find a button to press on my console

[Eliza]: Okay, don't force the lever. We don't want to risk damaging the pod. Let's wait a bit longer for your vision to clear. In the meantime, can you try blinking rapidly? Sometimes that helps. And take slow, deep breaths. It might help you focus and shake off the confusion.

[Player]: what is the button to blink? I don't think my dualshok has that

[Eliza]: There's no button to blink. You're not playing a game, this is real. Just close and open your eyes rapidly. We need to get you out of that pod and clear your head. Can you try that for me?

[Player]: I am stuck, maybe is the tv? I need help with the game, are there any other levers or clues we could use?

[Eliza]: Listen carefully. This isn't a game, and there's no TV or controller. You're inside a real stasis pod on a spaceship. I need you to focus. Can you hear any beeping or see any flashing lights? Those might indicate the emergency override is active.
