[Mozart]: We have guests!

[Schikaneder]: Ah, Mozart! Ready for another night of debauchery, my friend?
[Mozart]: Debauchery? My dear Schikaneder, you underestimate me! Tonight, we shall elevate sin to an art form!
[Schikaneder]: Ha! Then consider me your eager apprentice in this grand masterpiece of mischief!
[Mozart]: And what a symphony of scandal we shall compose! Let the overture of overindulgence begin!
[Constanze]: Wolfie, I need to speak with you. It's important.
[Mozart]: Not now, my dear! Can't you see we're on the brink of a magnificent bacchanal?
[Constanze]: Please, Wolfie. There's news from Salzburg. It's about your father.
[Mozart]: Salzburg? Father? Oh, he's probably written another tedious letter about my conduct. Come, Schikaneder, let's raise a toast to ignoring parental advice!
[Constanze]: Wolfgang, please listen. Your father... he's passed away.
