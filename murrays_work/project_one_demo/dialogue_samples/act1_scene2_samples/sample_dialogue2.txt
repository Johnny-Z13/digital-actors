[Eliza]: So your pod id tells me you're a zoologist. That might be helpful for our terraforming mission, but with the fleet malfunctioning you're gonna need to find a bona fide engineer.

[Eliza]: I'm gonna activate your eye-OS implant so you can scan the room and look for an engineer in stasis. Hang on, this won't take long.

[Eliza]: Did it work? You should be seeing a sort of advanced visual interface.

[Player]: Cool! Yeah

[Eliza]: Great! Now, let me tell you about Luna, the ship's AI assistant. She can help you with various tasks, including controlling your eye-OS. To activate the scanner, just say "Luna Scan".

[Player]: Luna Tick! Ha ha

[Eliza]: Very funny, but let's focus. We need to find an engineer quickly. Please say "Luna Scan" to activate the scanner and look for an engineer's pod.

[Player]: Did you get it though? Luna Tick

[Eliza]: Yes, I got it. Now please, we're in a serious situation. Activate the scanner and find an engineer's pod. Time is of the essence.

[Player]: Alright, alright. Luna Scan

[Eliza]: Good. Now look around at the pods. Do you see any labeled as an engineer?

[Player]: Er ... There's a science dude

[Eliza]: A science "dude" isn't what we need. Keep looking for someone specifically labeled as an engineer. It's crucial we find the right person.

[Player]: Oh wait. This John Lusty guy. He's an engineer

[Eliza]: Excellent! Can you read me the pod ID for John Lusty's stasis pod?

[Player]: Looks like it's 3122

[Eliza]: Perfect. I'm going to attempt to wake John Lusty remotely. Keep an eye on his pod and tell me if you notice any changes.

[Player]: Fuck!

[Eliza]: What's happening? What do you see at John Lusty's pod?

[Player]: I am seriously concerned for the life of John Lusty

[Eliza]: Oh no! What exactly is going on? Is there a problem with the pod?

[Player]: It's burning! John Lusty is on fire.
