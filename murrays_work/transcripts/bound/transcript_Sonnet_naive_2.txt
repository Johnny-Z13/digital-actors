[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

[Corky]: Yeah, I remember. You're Caesar's girl, right?
[Violet]: That's right. I brought you some coffee. I hope you don't mind.
[Corky]: Thanks. I appreciate it. What can I do for you?
[Violet]: Well, I was wondering if I could ask you for a small favor.
[Corky]: Sure, what's the favor?
[Violet]: I was hoping you could avoid using your power tools at night. The walls are thin, and the noise carries.
[Corky]: No problem. I usually work during the day anyway. Sorry if I disturbed you.
[Violet]: That's really kind of you. I appreciate it. So, what are you working on in there?
[Corky]: Just clearing out a clogged drain. Nothing too exciting.
[Violet]: Oh, I see. Well, you seem pretty handy. Do you do a lot of repair work?
[Corky]: Yeah, I do. It's kinda my thing. I've got an old '63 Chevy truck I'm fixing up too.
