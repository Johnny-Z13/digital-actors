[Mozart]: We have guests!

[Constanze]: Wolfi, please. I need to speak with you alone.
[Mozart]: Nonsense, my dear! The more, the merrier! Come, everyone, let's have a drink to celebrate our grand success!
[Constanze]: Wolfgang, please. This is serious. Your father...
[Mozart]: Oh, Papa? Has he finally decided to visit us in Vienna? Splendid! We'll throw him a grand party!
[Constanze]: No, Wolfi. Your father... he's dead.
