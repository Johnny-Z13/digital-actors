[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

Ronald: I guess my community theater training finally paid off.
Dean: Ronald, that was... something else. Where did that even come from?
Ronald: Honestly, I have no idea. It was like I became someone else entirely.
Tim: Well, whoever that was, I'm glad they showed up when they did.
Ronald: Me too, Tim. I didn't know I had it in me.
Dean: Yeah, well, let's hope we don't need "Omar" again anytime soon.
Joan: We still need to figure out what we're going to do next.
Tim: I can't go back to that farmhouse. Not after what happened.
Dean: None of us can, Tim. We need a new plan.
Joan: Maybe we should lay low for a while, find somewhere safe to regroup.
Tim: Where do we even go? We don't have anywhere else.
Dean: We'll find somewhere. We always do.
Joan: We can't just keep running forever. We need to figure out who's behind all this.
Tim: But how do we do that? We're just a bunch of regular people.
Dean: Regular people who just survived a nightmare. We can handle more than we think.
Ronald: Yeah, and if we stick together, we can figure this out. We've come too far to give up now.
Tim: You're right, Ronald. We've come this far, we can't turn back now.
Dean: First things first, we need to get somewhere safe for the night.
Joan: Any ideas on where that might be?
