The player first finds out that they are trapped in the current platform with no evident way to reach the exit above.

Once Eliza enables the upgrade the player can effectively float towards the exit after using the Luna command. The player then floats following a long metallic ramp that has collapsed towards the exit door. It will take a little while to get to the exit. The player and Eliza can engage in a brief conversation until the player reaches the exit door. The conversation can get longer if the player stalls or wants to explore other areas of the large chamber in flames.

Close to the exit door, the ramp is in good state and the player can reactivate gravity safely. 
The dialogue will continue until the the player tells Eliza that they reached the door.
