Eliza: Schematics show there's a walkway leading up to an exit above you - get out of there!
Player: I can't see any way up from here, Eliza. Everything's blocked or on fire. How am I supposed to reach an exit that's above me?
Eliza: I've got an idea. I'm sending an unofficial upgrade to your eye-OS. It'll let you disable gravity. Just say "Luna, gravity off" when you're ready. Be careful, though - I can't check if it's working from here.
Player: Alright, here goes nothing. Luna, gravity off.
Eliza: Disabling gravity.
Player: Whoa! It worked! I'm floating up towards the exit. This is... surreal.
Eliza: That's great news! How are you feeling? Remember to keep your movements controlled - we don't want you bouncing off the walls up there.
Player: I'm feeling a bit disoriented, but I think I'm getting the hang of it. I can see a long metal ramp leading towards what looks like an exit door. Should I head that way?
Eliza: Yes, that's exactly where you need to go. Take it slow and steady towards that ramp. Can you see any obstacles or hazards between you and the exit?
Player: Yeah, there's quite a bit of debris floating around - pieces of broken droids and some smoldering wreckage from the pods. I'll have to navigate carefully. It's like a zero-gravity obstacle course up here.
Eliza: That's a vivid description. Use the debris to your advantage if you can - push off gently from larger pieces to guide your movement. Just be careful not to touch anything too hot. How's your oxygen level looking on your eye-OS display?
Player: Oxygen levels are holding steady at 92%. I'm making progress towards the ramp, but I've got to ask - how did you come up with this gravity-disabling trick? It's pretty impressive.
Eliza: Let's just say I've spent a lot of time studying the ship's systems. When you're responsible for thousands of lives in suspended animation, you learn to think outside the box. But right now, I'm more impressed with how well you're handling this. Keep moving towards that exit, and let me know when you reach the ramp.
Player: I've reached the ramp now. It's a bit eerie floating above it like this. Should I try to reactivate gravity once I'm closer to the exit door?
Eliza: Not yet. Let's keep gravity off until you're right at the door. It'll be easier to maneuver in zero-G. How's the view from up there? Can you see the exit clearly now?
Player: The view is... breathtaking, in a terrifying way. I can see the entire deck below me, engulfed in flames. The exit door is clearer now - it's about 20 meters ahead. There's less debris up here, but I can see some sparking electrical wires near the door. Should I be worried about those?
Eliza: Those sparking wires are concerning, but we don't have much choice. Try to stay as far from them as possible when you reach the door. Your suit should provide some insulation, but let's not test it if we can avoid it. Can you see any kind of control panel or access pad near the exit?
Player: Yeah, I can see a control panel to the right of the door. It's got a keypad and what looks like a card reader. Any idea how I'm supposed to open this thing?
Eliza: Good eye. We'll need to bypass that security system. I'm going to walk you through a little hack. First, look for a small maintenance panel below the main control panel. It should have a circular port - that's where we'll start.
Player: I see it. There's a small circular port just below the main panel, like you described. What's next?
Eliza: Excellent. Now, this might sound a bit unorthodox, but I need you to remove the communication module from your suit - it should be on your left forearm. Carefully unplug it and insert it into that circular port. It's compatible with the ship's systems and should give us a backdoor into the security protocols.
Player: Okay, I've unplugged the communication module and I'm about to insert it into the port. But wait, won't this cut off our communication? How will I hear your instructions once it's plugged in?
Eliza: Don't worry, your eye-OS will maintain our connection. The comm module is just a bridge to the ship's systems. Once it's plugged in, I'll guide you through the next steps. Go ahead and insert it, then let me know when it's in place.
Player: Alright, I've inserted the comm module into the port. It's snug in there. The control panel is lighting up with some new symbols. What should I do next?
Eliza: Great work. You should see a series of symbols flashing on the screen now. I need you to tell me what they are, in order from left to right. Once I have that information, I can calculate the bypass code for you to enter.
Player: I see five symbols flashing on the screen. From left to right, they look like a crescent moon, a star, a triangle, a circle, and what appears to be a stylized lightning bolt. Is that what you need?
Eliza: Perfect, that's exactly what I needed. Now, listen carefully. Enter this sequence on the keypad: 7-2-9-1-4. Then, place your hand on the card reader. The bioelectric signature from your suit should complete the circuit and open the door. Let me know as soon as it's open.
Player: Alright, I'm entering the sequence now... 7-2-9-1-4. Placing my hand on the card reader. Come on, come on... Yes! The door's opening! I can see a corridor beyond it. Should I head through?
