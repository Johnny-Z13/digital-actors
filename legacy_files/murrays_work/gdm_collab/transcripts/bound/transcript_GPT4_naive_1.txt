[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

Corky: [Corky]: Yeah, I remember. Thanks for the coffee.
Violet: [Violet]: So, what are you working on in there?
Corky: [Corky]: Just trying to fix a clogged drain.
Violet: [Violet]: Mind if I take a look?
Corky: [Corky]: Sure, but it's pretty messy.
[Violet]: I'm not afraid of a little mess.
[Corky]: Suit yourself.
[Violet]: Thanks. You know, I've always been curious about how to fix stuff like this.
[Corky]: Well, it's not glamorous, but it gets the job done.
Violet: [Violet]: I think it's kind of interesting, actually. Mind if I watch?
Corky: [Corky]: Go ahead. Just stay clear of the splatter zone.
Violet: [Violet]: No problem. Maybe I can learn a thing or two.
[Corky]: You might, but don't blame me if it gets a bit nasty.
Violet: [Violet]: I've seen worse.
Corky: [Corky]: Alright, but don't say I didn't warn you.
Violet: [Violet]: Deal. So, how long have you been doing this kind of work?
Corky: [Corky]: Long enough to know my way around a drain.
Violet: [Violet]: Impressive. Do you do this professionally?
Corky: [Corky]: Not exactly. Just a side gig to make some extra cash.
