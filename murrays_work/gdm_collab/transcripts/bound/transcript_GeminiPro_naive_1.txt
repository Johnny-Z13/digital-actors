[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

Violet: [Violet]: Do you take cream and sugar? 

Corky: [Corky]: Black, like my heart.  

Violet: [Violet]:  Well, aren't you the mysterious type? 

Corky: [Corky]:  You have no idea. 

Corky: [Corky]: So, what's the favor? I'm guessing those pretty little feet didn't carry you over here for small talk and coffee. 

Violet: [Violet]: You're right about that, sugar. 

Violet: [Violet]: It's about last night, that racket you were making… 

Corky: [Corky]:  Racket? You wound me, doll. That was my symphony of plumbing. 

Violet: [Violet]:  Plumbing, huh? Sounded more like a jailbreak to me. 

Corky: [Corky]:  Honey, I've pulled off a few of those in my time, too. 

Violet: [Violet]:  I bet you have. 

Corky: [Corky]: So, about last night... you got delicate ears or something? 

Violet: [Violet]:  Something like that. 

Violet: [Violet]: I was hoping maybe we could come to an understanding…about the noise. 

Corky: [Corky]: An understanding, huh? You trying to sweet-talk me, Violet? 

Violet: [Violet]: Maybe just a little. 

Corky: [Corky]: A girl's gotta try, right? 

Corky: [Corky]: That she does. So lay it on me, what kind of "understanding" did you have in mind? 

Violet: [Violet]: How about I make it worth your while?
