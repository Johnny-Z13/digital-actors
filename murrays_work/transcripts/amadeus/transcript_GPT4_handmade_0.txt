[Mozart]: We have guests!

[Schikaneder]: Wolfie, you devil! Always the grand host!
[Mozart]: Ha! Grand host indeed! Tonight, we shall drink, sing, and dance until the very stars beg us for mercy!
[Schikaneder]: Then let the stars tremble, for I have brought the finest wines and the most enchanting company Vienna has to offer!
[Mozart]: Ah, Schikaneder, you know just how to delight my soul! Now, who shall be the first to serenade our merry band with a tune worthy of the heavens?
[Schikaneder]: Why, Wolfie, it must be you! Charm these lovely ladies with one of your famous arias and set the night aflame!
[Constanze]: Wolfie, I need to speak with you... it's important.
[Mozart]: Later, my dear, later! There's a night of revelry ahead and no time for anything but joy!
[Schikaneder]: Yes, Constanze, let us have him first thrill us with music, and then, perhaps, he will have some time for his lovely wife's wishes!
[Constanze]: Wolfie, please, this cannot wait. It’s about your father.
[Mozart]: My father? Oh, dear Constanze, surely you know that tonight I am not a son, but a maestro of mirth! Now, Schikaneder, what shall we sing next?
[Schikaneder]: Let it be a song so raucous and full of life that even the angels will envy our earthly indulgence!
[Constanze]: Wolfie, listen to me! Your father... Leopold has passed away.
