---

## Environment Description

Create a medieval wizard's workshop interior carved from weathered stone. The space should feel intimate (12-15 feet wide), cluttered with purpose, and emanate mystical warmth. This is an alchemist's laboratory meets ancient library - centuries of accumulated magical knowledge visible in every corner.

## Key Environmental Elements

### Architecture
- **Walls:** Rough-hewn stone with warm aged patina, moss or glowing magical runes in crevices
- **Ceiling:** 12-15 feet high with exposed dark wooden beams
- **Floor:** Uneven stone flagstones, worn smooth in walking paths
- **Doorway:** Single arched gothic doorway (dark wood door, iron hinges)
- **Windows:** None or one small arched window with leaded glass

### Central Workshop Features
- **Cauldron:** Large cast-iron cauldron (3-4 feet diameter) in corner, actively bubbling with luminescent green or purple liquid, steam rising creating atmospheric haze
- **Worktable:** Heavy wooden table (6 feet long), cluttered with:
  - Brass alchemical instruments (retorts, alembics, distillation tubes)
  - Mortar and pestle sets
  - Open grimoires with illuminated pages
  - Crystal spheres (some glowing)
  - Scattered ingredients and vials
- **Shelving:** Floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves (warped, dark with age) covering all walls:
  - Glass jars containing glowing liquids (amber, green, blue, purple)
  - Dried herbs, roots, and mysterious powders
  - Preserved specimens in fluid
  - Ceramic pots with handwritten labels (flowing calligraphy on yellowed parchment)
- **Books:** Ancient leather-bound tomes stacked on every surface, some floating mid-air defying gravity

### Magical Elements (Critical Features)
- **Floating Candles:** 20-30 candles hovering at various heights (2-10 feet), primary light source
  - Warm orange-yellow flame (color temperature ~2000K)
  - Gentle bobbing/drifting motion (slow, lazy patterns)
  - No visible support - pure levitation
  - Create dancing shadows across all surfaces
- **Glowing Crystals:** Scattered throughout shelves and worktable
  - Amethyst, quartz, and unnatural luminescent varieties
  - Pulsing soft blue/purple glow
- **Magical Artifact:** One prominent glowing object on worktable (choice of):
  - Crystal ball emanating blue light
  - Enchanted mirror with swirling surface
  - Glowing orrery (spinning celestial model)

### Additional Props & Details
- **Gnarled wooden staff** leaning in corner, crystal pommel glowing softly
- **Dried herbs and roots** hanging from ceiling beams on twine
- **Brass/copper equipment:** Astrolabes, orreries, telescopes, compasses
- **Scrolls:** Partially unrolled on table showing star charts, magical circles, ancient scripts
- **Dusty particles** visible in light beams (volumetric lighting effect)
- **Cobwebs** in upper corners (adds age, not abandonment)
- **Small wooden crates** or barrels with arcane symbols stenciled

---

## Atmosphere & Mood

- **Mystical yet welcoming** - not ominous or threatening
- **Cluttered organized chaos** - everything has purpose but placement is eccentric
- **Warm and lived-in** - this is a home workshop, not a cold laboratory
- **Ancient wisdom** - sense of accumulated knowledge over centuries
- **Intimate scale** - personal study, not grand wizard tower
- **Active magic** - cauldron bubbling, candles floating, crystals pulsing (not static museum)

---

## Lighting Specifications

### Primary Lighting
- **Source:** 20-30 floating candles (warm orange-yellow, ~2000K)
- **Quality:** Flickering, organic, creates dancing shadows
- **Coverage:** Distributed throughout space at varying heights

### Accent Lighting
- **Magical blue glow** from crystals and artifacts (#4466ff, cool blue)
- **Cauldron illumination** from bubbling liquid (green or purple glow)
- **Jar glow** from potion bottles on shelves (amber, green, blue - varied)

### Ambient Lighting
- **Background color:** Deep midnight purple (#1a1520) for shadowed areas
- **No natural light** - underground or tower room aesthetic
- **Volumetric effects:** Steam from cauldron, dust particles in candlelight beams

### Shadow & Contrast
- High contrast - candlelight creates dramatic shadows
- Surfaces have warm highlights (amber) and cool shadows (purple/blue)
- Avoid flat/even lighting - embrace chiaroscuro

## Camera Specifications

### Primary Viewing Angle
- **Position:** (1.13, 2.92, 1.58) relative to scene center
- **Look Direction:** Slightly down and toward main workshop area
- **Focus:** Worktable, cauldron, and floating candles should be prominently visible
- **Height:** Human eye level (~5.5-6 feet from floor)

### Field of View
- **FOV:** 55-65 degrees (slight wide angle to capture workshop density)
- **Depth of Field:** Moderate - worktable sharp, distant shelves slightly soft (adds depth)

### Framing Goals
- Worktable in mid-ground (hero prop)
- Floating candles visible throughout frame
- Cauldron visible in background or side
- Shelves visible on walls (framing composition)
- Doorway or architectural element for depth

## Style References

### Visual Style
- **Harry Potter:** Dumbledore's office (cluttered magical artifacts, lived-in warmth)
- **D&D / Fantasy RPG:** Classic wizard tower aesthetic
- **Medieval alchemy:** Historical alchemist laboratory references
- **The Sorcerer's Apprentice:** Magical workshop chaos

### Cinematic References
- *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* - Dumbledore's office scenes
- *Fantasia* - Sorcerer's Apprentice segment
- *The Lord of the Rings* - Gandalf's study (implied)
- *Doctor Strange* - Sanctum Sanctorum library (magical clutter)

### Artistic Style
- **Not modern/clean** - embrace weathered, ancient quality
- **Not dark/evil** - warm and welcoming despite mystical elements
- **Not minimalist** - dense with props and details
- **Fantasy realism** - magical but physically plausible

---

## Production Notes

### Optimization Priorities
1. Floating candles are signature visual - must be prominent and well-lit
2. Worktable is hero surface - highest detail budget
3. Shelves can use texture repetition (many jars)
4. Cauldron particle effects (steam, bubbles) add significant atmosphere
5. Volumetric lighting (dust, steam) is critical for mood

### Avoid
- ❌ Overly dark/ominous atmosphere (this is welcoming)
- ❌ Clean/modern materials (everything is aged)
- ❌ Flat lighting (embrace shadows and contrast)
- ❌ Empty spaces (clutter is intentional)
- ❌ Static scene (candles float, cauldron bubbles, particles drift)
