Eliza: Schematics show there's a walkway leading up to an exit above you - get out of there!
Player: Luna, gravity off.
Eliza: Did that work?  Can you see a walkway above?
Player: Yeah, I'm floating!  I see a ramp.
Eliza: Good.  Just keep heading towards it.  It's probably a service ramp, not exactly designed for... leisurely strolls.
Player: This ramp is a bit… *longer* than I anticipated.
Eliza: How's the view?  Anything interesting up there besides rusty pipes and flickering emergency lights?
Player: I think I see a door at the end of this ramp.
Eliza: Almost there! Just a little further...  Are you feeling alright?
Player: It's getting a little less... fiery up here.
Eliza: Good.  Let's hope that door leads somewhere useful.
Player: Almost there.
Eliza: Almost at the door.  Let me know when you’re through it.
Player: I'm through the door!
Eliza: Excellent!  Now, let's get you patched into the main network.  Report to the bridge immediately.
Player: It's surprisingly breezy up here.
Eliza: Just breathe, you’re doing great.
Player: And surprisingly quiet.
Eliza: I’ll send through your vitals to the bridge now.  They’ll be expecting you.
Player: I'm getting a little dizzy.
Eliza: Focus, almost there.
Player: Okay, I think I can see the control room.
Eliza: Just a little further, you're doing brilliantly.
Player: Okay, I'm at the door.
Eliza: Almost there, almost there... just a few more steps.
Player: Okay, I'm through the door!
Eliza: Excellent work!  Now, breathe deeply and try to relax.
Player: It smells like burnt toast.
Eliza: Well, that was a bit more exciting than your average Tuesday, wasn't it?
Player: It's surprisingly cold up here.
Eliza: Just try to ignore the smell; the air filtration system should kick in any minute now.
Player: It's surprisingly quiet.
Eliza: Glad to hear you made it. Now, focus on getting to the bridge.  We need to figure out what started this fire.
Player: It's surprisingly empty.
Eliza: And try not to bump into anything on your way.  Those escape pods aren't exactly lightweight.
Player: Okay, I'm at the door.
Eliza: Almost there... I can see the bridge from here!
Player: I'm through the door!
Eliza: Good. Now, tell me everything you saw up there.
Player: It's surprisingly spacious.
Eliza: And surprisingly… intact?
Player: Surprisingly...clean.
Eliza: Except for the faint smell of singed circuitry, of course.
Player: It's surprisingly...bright.
Eliza: And surprisingly… quiet, you say? That’s… unusual.
Player: It's surprisingly… empty.
Eliza: Well, that's a relief.  Let's hope the rest of the ship is in better shape.
Player: Okay, I'm at the bridge.
Eliza: Report.
Player: It's surprisingly…cold.
