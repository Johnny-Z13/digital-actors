      "dialogue_summary Recently awakened chief medical officer Eliza on the Salvador, concerned for the player's and others' safety including her family in cryo, successfully used \"BRAVO TANGO DELTA\" to open John Smith's pod. John identified himself as a Chicago-born history teacher with a love for old movies and baseball. However, the recently awakened player helping Eliza is a Chicagoan zoologist, not much of a baseball fan, who also prefers movies and hasn't seen 'Metropolis'. The player, assisting Eliza via their eye-OS implant and AI Luna, located engineer John Lusty in pod ED 3122, but waking him caused an error and a fire. Now, a fire has broken out, alarms are sounding, emergency drones are malfunctioning due to communications being down, and the emergency power rings have stopped cycling, causing a total power failure. Eliza instructed the player to abandon Lusty and head to the control room, but the player is reluctant. Eliza also sent the player an unofficial eye-OS upgrade allowing temporary gravity manipulation via \"Luna, gravity off,\" and the player is currently floating upwards through a burning section. Eliza used to take her kids to a planetarium on Earth and is more of a 'Casablanca' fan.

Eliza, a doctor who joined the mission for her children's future and to establish a healthy community on Terra Nova, has two young children and a husband in cryo sleep. Alex's activated eye-OS implant, upgraded unofficially by Eliza, allowed them to locate engineer John Lusty in pod ED 3122 and disable gravity with a voice command.
