[6.0] Ok so your pod id tells me you're a zoologist. That might be helpful for our terraforming mission, but with the fleet malfunctioning we need to find a bona fide engineer..... I am activating your eye-OS implant so you can scan the room for an engineer in stasis. There should be a sort of advanced visual interface appearing in your field of view...... Did you see anything?
