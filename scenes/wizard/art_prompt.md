## Generation Details

**Date:** 2026-01-31 (Updated to MerlinsRoom2)
**Model:** World Labs Marble
**Export Format:** GLB (138MB)
**File:** merlins_room2.glb
**Previous Version:** merlins_workshop.glb (136MB)

## Original Prompt

*Note: This model was created before the scene-centric reorganization. The exact prompt used is unknown, but the environment characteristics suggest the following:*

A medieval wizard's workshop with:
- Wooden workbench cluttered with spell components
- Ancient tomes and scrolls
- Magical artifacts and potions
- Dim atmospheric lighting (candlelight, magical glow)
- Stone walls with mystical runes
- Shelves filled with ingredients and tools
- Warm, mysterious ambiance

## Camera Configuration

**Position:** (1.13, 2.92, 1.58)
**Target:** (0.47, 2.98, 0.83)
**FOV:** 60°

**View Description:**
Camera is positioned to provide an optimal view of Merlin's workbench with spell components clearly visible. The angle slightly looks down at the workspace, giving the player a sense of being at the wizard's side while he works on magical experiments.

## Notes

- Model uses dark materials that benefit from `fixBlackMaterials: true`
- Scene includes multiple floating candles (added programmatically, not part of GLB)
- Atmospheric purple/blue lighting added to enhance magical atmosphere
- Original model path was `/art/MerlinsRoom.glb`, migrated to `/scenes/wizard/merlins_workshop.glb`
- Updated 2026-01-31: Now using `/scenes/wizard/merlins_room2.glb` (from `/art/MerlinsRoom2.glb`)

## Recommendations for Future Exports

If regenerating this environment:
1. Request more varied lighting (less pure black materials)
2. Add more detail to spell components on workbench
3. Include mystical floating objects
4. Emphasize depth with layered shelves and alcoves
5. Add visible runes or glowing magical elements
