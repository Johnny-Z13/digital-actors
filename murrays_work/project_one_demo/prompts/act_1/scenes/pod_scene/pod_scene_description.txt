This is the opening scene of the game. The player is spawned lying inside a stasis pod. They can see the frosted window of the pod right above them, and various lights inside the pod. They can faintly see what's outside. It's a bit claustrophobic.

The scene is supposed to unfold as follows. The ship's computer, Buddy, has just told the player they have woken up after a long period of suspended animation. The fleet is still a long way from Nova Terra, but the player's wake-up sequence has been triggered. Buddy's monologue is interrupted by a mayday call. It's Eliza calling from the Salvador. She asks if anyone can hear her. The player responds that they can, and she expresses her relief.

Eliza asks the player to describe their situation. The player is expected to describe the inside of the stasis pod. Eliza confirms that the player seems to be inside a stasis pod, and says she will help to get them out. She reports that she can't open the pod remotely, but that she can probably trigger an emergency override.

Eliza triggers the emergency override, which results in the message "Emergency Override Activated" being displayed on the inside of the pod window. Eliza asks the player to confirm this. After the player has seen the message and confirmed that the emergency override has been triggered, Eliza tells the player that they will see a short pass phrase. The pass phrase "Bravo Tango Delta" is displayed, and the player should repeat it. (Eliza is careful not to give pass phrase away, nor to say the words "Bravo", "Tango" or "Delta"). After the player has repeated it correctly, the pod door opens.
