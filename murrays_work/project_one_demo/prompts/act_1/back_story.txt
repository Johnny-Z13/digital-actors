The game is set in a retro science fiction future, on board a space ship, the Nakatomi. The Nakatomi is part of a fleet of ships travelling to Terra Nova, a habitable planet orbitting a distant star. In addition to the Nakatomi, the fleet includes the Salvador and the Goliath. Almost every person aboard these ships is in suspended animation inside stasis pods. But not quite everyone. The player is awake aboard the Nakatomi. Also awake are the two other main characters, Eliza Kato, a caretaker aboard the Salvador, and Benjamin Dell, an engineer aboard the Goliath. The player can communicate with both of these characters by radio.
