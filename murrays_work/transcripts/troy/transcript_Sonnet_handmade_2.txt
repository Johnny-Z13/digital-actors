[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

[Odysseus]: Achilles, my friend, I come on behalf of Agamemnon. We need your strength in this war against Troy.
[Achilles]: Agamemnon? Ha! That man has no right to ask for my strength after how he's treated me. Why should I risk my life for his quarrel?
[Odysseus]: This isn't just Agamemnon's quarrel, Achilles. Think of the glory you could win facing the likes of Hector. Your name would echo through the ages!
[Achilles]: Glory? I've won enough glory to last ten lifetimes. What good is fame if I'm dead and can't enjoy it? No, Odysseus, you'll have to do better than that.
[Odysseus]: Consider your cousin Patroclus, then. He's determined to join this war. Without you there to protect him, who knows what fate might befall him on the battlefield?
[Achilles]: Patroclus? He's a skilled warrior in his own right. But... you're right, he can be reckless. Still, I won't be manipulated by your clever words, Odysseus. My decision is my own to make.
[Odysseus]: I understand your hesitation, Achilles. But remember, history remembers those who act, not those who sit idle. Troy's walls await a hero of your caliber.
[Achilles]: Troy's walls, you say? And what of the walls Agamemnon has built between us with his disrespect? Those seem just as insurmountable to me, Odysseus.
[Odysseus]: Walls can be scaled, Achilles, especially by one as great as you. Think of the songs they'll sing of the hero who breached Troy's defenses and brought glory to all Greece.
[Achilles]: Songs? I've heard enough songs. What I want is respect, Odysseus. Not empty praise from poets who weren't there, but true recognition from those I fight alongside.
[Odysseus]: Respect is earned on the battlefield, Achilles. Join us, and you'll have not just Agamemnon's recognition, but the admiration of every Greek soldier and the fear of every Trojan warrior.
[Achilles]: Your words are as smooth as ever, Odysseus, but they can't smooth over the cracks in Agamemnon's leadership. Tell me, why should I trust a king who values his pride more than his best warrior?
[Odysseus]: Because this war is bigger than Agamemnon's pride or your grievances, Achilles. It's about the honor of Greece itself. Can you truly stand aside while history unfolds without you?
[Achilles]: Honor of Greece? And what of my honor, Odysseus? I've bled for Greece more times than I can count. Perhaps it's time Greece bled for me.
[Odysseus]: Achilles, your honor is bound to Greece's fate. By fighting for Greece, you fight for yourself. The greater our victory, the greater your legend becomes. Can you afford to let this opportunity slip away?
[Achilles]: Legend? Opportunity? You speak of war as if it's a game, Odysseus. But I've seen the true face of battle. It's not glory - it's blood and pain and loss. Why should I embrace that again?
[Odysseus]: Because you were born for it, Achilles. The blood, the pain, the loss - they forge the greatest heroes. And deep down, you know there's no place you'd rather be than at the heart of this epic conflict.
[Achilles]: You presume to know my heart, Odysseus? Perhaps I've changed. Perhaps I've grown weary of being a pawn in the games of kings and gods. What then?
[Odysseus]: Then you'd be denying your very nature, Achilles. The fire that burns within you isn't easily extinguished. Can you truly live with yourself, knowing you turned your back on the greatest battle of our age?
