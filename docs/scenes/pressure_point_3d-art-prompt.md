# World Labs 3D Generation Prompt: Pressure Point (Submarine Interior)

## Scene Overview
Damaged submarine aft compartment at 2,400 feet depth. Emergency state - radiation spreading, systems failing, water seeping in. Cold industrial metal environment with sparking panels and tilted perspective.

---

## Environment Description

Create the interior of a military/research submarine's aft compartment in critical emergency state. The space is cramped, tilted 15 degrees (submarine listing), with emergency lighting casting harsh shadows. This is a life-or-death survival environment - everything conveys pressure, danger, and failing systems.

## Key Environmental Elements

### Architecture & Structure
- **Walls:** Riveted metal panels (gunmetal gray/blue), curved to form cylinder
- **Ceiling:** Pipes and conduits running along length, some sparking with exposed wiring
- **Floor:** Metal grating or solid steel deck, tilted 15 degrees (submarine listing), water pooling
- **Dimensions:** Cramped - 8-10 feet wide, 12 feet long, 7 feet tall
- **Curvature:** Cylindrical walls (submarine hull interior)
- **Hatches:** Sealed bulkhead door (inaccessible - separation from forward control), heavy wheel lock

### Central Control Panel (Hero Prop)
- **Location:** Facing player, mounted on wall
- **Style:** 1970s-80s submarine aesthetic (analog gauges, chunky physical buttons)
- **Key Elements:**
  - **Radiation Gauge:** Large circular analog gauge, needle at 0% but slowly moving, red danger zone marked at 95%
  - **Time Display:** Digital countdown timer (red LED), shows "08:00" at start
  - **Four Control Buttons:**
    - O2 VALVE (red, glowing)
    - VENT (orange, glowing)
    - BALLAST (blue, glowing)
    - POWER (green, glowing)
  - **Warning Lights:** Red and amber indicator lights, some flashing
  - **Labels:** Military stencil lettering, worn and weathered
- **Damage:** Cracked glass on one gauge, exposed wiring behind panel edge, scorch marks

### Critical Props
- **Porthole (Left Wall):** Small circular window (12 inches diameter), thick reinforced glass showing:
  - Deep murky blue-green ocean water
  - Occasional bubbles rising past
  - Bioluminescent particles drifting (optional)
  - Sense of immense depth (very dark)
- **Intercom Speaker:** Military-grade mesh speaker unit, crackling with static (James's voice source)
- **Emergency Equipment:** Fire extinguisher, first aid kit strapped to walls
- **Crank/Generator:** Manual hand crank for emergency power (rusty, functional)
- **Flood Med Bay Button:** Appears later - bright red, positioned above other controls (Phase 3+)

### Environmental Damage Details
- **Water:** Dripping from ceiling pipes, pooling on tilted floor, running down walls
- **Sparks:** Exposed wiring sparking periodically from damaged panels
- **Steam/Smoke:** Atmospheric haze from damaged systems, catches light
- **Condensation:** All metal surfaces show moisture/droplets
- **Scorch Marks:** Black carbon scoring around electrical failures
- **Flickering Lights:** Emergency lighting unstable, suggests power fluctuations

---

## Atmosphere & Mood

- **Claustrophobic** - tight metal space, no escape
- **Emergency state** - NOT calm operation, everything is failing
- **Cold and damp** - metal surfaces, water everywhere, industrial chill
- **Immense pressure** - sense of deep ocean crushing from outside
- **Time running out** - countdown timer, rising radiation gauge create urgency
- **Industrial military** - functional, no comfort, purely utilitarian
- **Isolation** - trapped alone, separated from crew

---

## Lighting Specifications

### Primary Lighting
- **Emergency Floods:** Harsh amber/yellow fluorescent lights (flickering)
- **Position:** Ceiling-mounted, directional, creates strong shadows
- **Quality:** Unstable - occasional flicker, power surge effects

### Accent Lighting
- **Red Warning Strips:** LED strips along ceiling/walls (constant emergency state)
- **Gauge Backlighting:** Soft glow from radiation gauge, control panel indicators
- **Button Illumination:** Four control buttons glow their respective colors (red, orange, blue, green)
- **Porthole Ambient:** Faint deep blue light from ocean (minimal contribution)

### Electrical Arcs
- **Sparking Panels:** Bright white/blue arcs from exposed wiring (intermittent)
- **Flash Lighting:** Brief illumination from sparks, creates dynamic shadows

### Color Temperature
- **Amber Emergency Lights:** ~2800K (warm but industrial, not cozy)
- **Red Warning Lights:** Pure red (~650nm wavelength)
- **Blue from Porthole:** Cold deep ocean blue (~8000K+)

### Shadow & Contrast
- High contrast - harsh emergency lighting creates dramatic shadows
- Dark corners, strong highlights on metal surfaces
- Silhouettes from control panel lighting

---

## Camera Specifications

### Primary Viewing Angle
- **Position:** First-person from trapped position, facing control panel
- **Height:** Seated or crouched position (~4-5 feet from floor)
- **Tilt:** Camera tilted 15 degrees matching submarine list
- **Look Direction:** Directly at control panel, can turn to view porthole/hatch

### Movement
- **Static position** - player cannot move from spot (trapped)
- **Look around:** 360-degree head rotation (limited by cramped space)
- **Slight sway:** Optional subtle camera motion suggesting submarine instability/water movement

### Field of View
- **FOV:** 70-80 degrees (realistic human vision, enhances claustrophobia)
- **Depth of Field:** Short - control panel in sharp focus, background slightly soft

### Framing Goals
- Control panel dominates foreground (player's interface)
- Porthole visible to one side (connection to ocean)
- Ceiling pipes/damage visible overhead (environmental threat)
- Bulkhead door visible (blocked exit, reinforces trapped feeling)

## Production Notes

### Optimization Priorities
1. Control panel is hero prop - highest detail budget (gauges, buttons, labels)
2. Tilted floor/perspective is critical for disorientation effect
3. Water effects (drips, pools, reflections) add significant atmosphere
4. Sparking panels provide dynamic lighting interest
5. Porthole view must show depth and darkness of ocean

### Sound Design Cues (Visual Integration)
- Hull groans - metal stress visible in structural details
- Water dripping - visible drips catching light
- Alarm klaxons - warning lights flashing in sync
- Sparking - visible electrical arcs
- Intercom static - speaker unit visibly old/damaged

### Avoid
- ❌ Spacious/comfortable layout (must be cramped)
- ❌ Calm/stable lighting (must flicker and fail)
- ❌ Clean/new equipment (everything is damaged/aged)
- ❌ Bright lighting (harsh emergency state, dark shadows)
- ❌ Level perspective (15-degree tilt is critical)
