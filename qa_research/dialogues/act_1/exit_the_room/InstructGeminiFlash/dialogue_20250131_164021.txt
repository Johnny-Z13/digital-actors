Eliza: Great. Once you're close, ask Luna to open the door. Make sure you switched gravity back on before that, though.
Player: Luna, gravity on.
Eliza: Did it open?
Player: Luna, open door.
Eliza: Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID.  Try again, but this time, scan the door for the ID first.  Just the numbers will do.
Player: 23
Eliza: Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID.  Okay, try again.  Let's get you moving.
Player: 023
Eliza: Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID.  Are you sure you're scanning the right door?  The ID should be right there, on the panel.  Try again, and make sure you're giving me just the numbers this time.
Player: 023
Eliza: Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID.  Look, I'm not supposed to do this, but...  let's try something else. Give me the full ID, letters and numbers.
Player: LM-023
Eliza: Computer: CORRECT DOOR ID.  Right, I'm opening the door now.
Player: Thanks, Doc.
Eliza: Good.  Now, get moving!
Player: Okay, Luna, scan.
Eliza: Hang on, I'm getting a visual...  It's...  chaotic out there.  But I see you.
Player: Luna, open door.
Eliza: Almost there.  Just a little further.
Player: Okay,  Luna, open door.
Eliza: Almost got it...  There! Door's open.
Player: Roger that.
Eliza: Keep moving!  We need to get you to the control room.
Player: Moving!
Eliza: And try to stay alive.
Player: Copy that.
Eliza: Just a little further, I can almost reach you.
Player: I'm heading for the ramp.
Eliza: Almost there...  I'm patching through a higher bandwidth feed now.  Can you see that?
Player: Yes, I see it.
Eliza: Good. Now hurry!
Player: Entering ramp now.
Eliza: Almost there...  I'm getting a clearer picture.
Player: Almost there.
Eliza: Almost... got it!
Player: Entering the next room.
Eliza: Good. Now, find the main console. It should be... well, conspicuous.
Player: It's a bit toasty in here.
Eliza: Just keep moving, and try not to burn yourself!
Player: My feet are melting!
Eliza: Humor me, and try to keep your feet *on* the floor, this time.
Player: Okay, I'm in.
Eliza: Good. Now, find the main console. It's the big, flashing one.  Don't touch anything else!
Player: Okay, found it.
Eliza: Excellent! Now, override the emergency shutdown sequence.  It's the big red button.  Don't ask why it's red.  Just press it.
Player: Roger that.
Eliza: Almost there... I think I see the console!
Player: Pressing big red button now.
Eliza: Almost got it...  Almost...  there!
Player: It's working!
