      "\u001b[91mCorky, in her role as the new plumber and painter for the block, has just moved into an apartment on the same floor as Violet. Shortly before this scene, they met for the first time in the elevator, where they exchanged pleasantries and a couple of glances. Now Violet has turned up at Corky's door. The dialogue includes all the following elements, but as a skilled screenwriter you can weave them together seamlessly, ensuring the transitions from one topic of conversation are gradual, smooth, and natural. Violet likes the look of Corky and wants to get to know her, so she has brought her a cup of coffee. In a gentle way, she complains about Corky using noisy power tools early in the morning. (Violet is a night person.) Corky promises to hold off with the noise until a little later in the day. But Violet doesn't want to leave yet, so she questions Corky about her work, and, playing the part of a 'helpless female', tells her how impressed she is. The conversation continues, with Violet adopting a slightly flirtatious tone. Somehow investing the issue with a subtle erotic charge, Violet brings the conversation around to what Corky drives. Violet makes a few guesses what it might be. Somewhat bluntly, Corky eventually reveals that she drives a truck.\n",
