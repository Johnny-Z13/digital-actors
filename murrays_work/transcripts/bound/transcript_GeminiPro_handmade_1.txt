[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

[Corky]: Yeah, with the coffee.  Come on in, I was just about to have some myself.  You want it black, right?  Strong but sweet type? 

[Violet]:  You remembered.  And you're right, you *are* pretty observant...for someone who makes so much noise you could sleep through an earthquake. 

[Corky]:  Hey, a girl's gotta make a living, right?  What can I say?  Power tools are my love language, but I can keep it down for a while longer if you like.  So, what is it you do, Violet?  Besides making a tough broad blush, I mean. 

[Violet]: Oh, nothing nearly as impressive as all this, I'm sure. And please, call me Vi. I bet a woman who handles her tools like that drives something powerful, too. A Mustang, maybe?  Or a Corvette?

[Corky]: Honey, the only thing a Corvette and I have in common is we both turn heads. 

[Violet]:  Ooh, I like you even more now...so tell me, what *does* a girl have to do to get a ride in this mystery machine of yours? 

[Corky]: Just ask nicely...and maybe help me find the toolbox I accidentally buried under all these drop cloths. 

[Violet]:  Deal.  A girl like you doesn't need tools anyway...you can use your hands. 

[Corky]: You sayin' you got a job needs doin', Vi?  Because these hands are pretty good at fixin' things...or maybe just messin' 'em up a little. 

[Violet]:  Now that sounds like an offer I'd be a fool to refuse...but maybe we should start with that toolbox, huh?  Wouldn't want to keep a girl waitin'. 

[Corky]:  Girl, trust me, I know *exactly* how to make you wait.  Now, about that toolbox... 

[Corky]:  Last I saw it, it was parked right next to a sweet little convertible...sound familiar? 

[Violet]:  A girl after my own heart... I always did say there was nothing more elegant than a woman who knows her way around an engine...or a toolbox. 

[Corky]:  Elegant, huh?  That's not the word that usually springs to mind... more like "rugged," you know?  "Heavy duty."  Built to last. Like a...pickup truck. You ever driven one of those, city girl? 

[Violet]:  Now why would a girl like me drive anything else? 

[Corky]:  Get outta town... you're messin' with me, right? 

[Violet]:  Maybe...maybe not.  Tell you what, why don't you show me this truck of yours sometime, and I'll tell you all my secrets? 

[Corky]:  Secrets, huh?  You know, this whole "damsel in distress" act is kinda cute, but I gotta warn ya...I see right through you, Violet. 

[Violet]:  Good thing you like what you see then, isn't it?
