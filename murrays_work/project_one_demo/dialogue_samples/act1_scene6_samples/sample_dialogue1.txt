[Eliza]: Okay, I see you’re finally outside.  Now you just need to find the Hab.  Can you see a ... a thing that looks like a big, a big bubble?

[Player]: Yeah. I can see it.

[Eliza]: Great! That's the Bio Hab. Head straight for it, but take it slow and steady. How are you feeling out there? It's quite a view, isn't it?

[Player]: I'm heading across the void now. I love space walks. Always a bit nerve-wracking, but calming too.

[Eliza]: I'm glad you're enjoying it. My Papa used to say space walks were like constantly falling. He'd tell me, "Eliza, your brain doesn't know where 'up' is anymore." Did you ever feel that way?

[Player]: I always orient myself against some fixture. Right now I'm thinking of part of the Hab as the top. So that's up.

[Eliza]: That's smart. Papa would've liked that trick. Say, I just remembered something - is your suit blue by any chance?

[Player]: Er yeah. It's kind of blueish.

[Eliza]: Oh... okay. Well, don't worry, but there's been some issues with the blue suits getting a bit chilly on longer walks. You should be fine for this short trip, though. Just keep moving and let me know when you reach the Hab, alright?

[Player]: Issues? What issues?

[Eliza]: Well... there have been a few incidents where the temperature regulation in the blue suits malfunctioned during extended spacewalks. Some crew members experienced severe hypothermia. But listen, your walk is short, and I'm monitoring you closely. You're doing great, just keep moving towards the Hab.

[Player]: Hypothermia! For fuck's sake Eliza! You could have mentioned this before. I could have taken a different suit.

[Eliza]: I'm sorry, I really am! I should have mentioned it earlier. But please, try to stay calm. Panic won't help right now. You're almost at the Hab, and your vitals are stable. Just keep moving, okay? You're doing great.

[Player]: I'm not panicking. I'm just a bit cross with you. I feel fine.

[Eliza]: I understand you're upset, and you have every right to be. I made a mistake not telling you sooner. But I'm really glad you're feeling okay. Can you see the airlock on the Hab yet?

[Player]: Yes, I can see it. Still moving towards it.

[Eliza]: That's great news. You're making excellent progress. As soon as you reach the airlock, let me know and I'll guide you through the entry procedure. And... I truly am sorry about the suit information. I promise I'll be more forthcoming in the future.

[Player]: Nearly there.

[Eliza]: Okay, good. Take your time with the last few meters. When you reach the airlock, you'll need to look for a large, circular handle on the right side. Let me know when you're there and ready to begin the entry sequence.

[Player]: Were you close with your father?

[Eliza]: Oh, Papa? Yes, we were very close. He was my hero, really. Taught me everything I know about ships and space. It's... it's been hard without him. But let's focus on getting you inside safely now. Are you at the airlock yet?

[Player]: I never new my father. He died soon after I was born.

[Eliza]: I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing a parent is never easy, whether you knew them or not. But you know, in a way, we're all family out here in space. We look out for each other. Now, let's get you safely inside. Have you reached the airlock?

[Player]: I'm across now.
