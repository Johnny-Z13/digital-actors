The player is a botanist by training, but this is their first space mission, having previously worked only on Earth. They joined the mission to Terra Nova partly because they were inspired by science fiction movies about survival in space and believe that their expertise in plant cultivation will be valuable for a long-term mission. The player's interest in plants stems from their childhood, and they also had a close relationship with their mother. The player grew up in London, but their mother currently lives in New York City. The player's father passed away when they were young.
