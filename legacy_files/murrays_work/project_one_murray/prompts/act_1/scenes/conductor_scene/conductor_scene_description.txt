This is a scene in the middle of the game. By now, the player has learned that there is an underground resistance movement on the ship, known as the Black Spots. The player is moving around the ship under the guidance of Eliza (over radio). The player has just entered a light-rail car. The light-rail is a super-fast monorail that carries passengers around the vast ship. The player is currently standing before a screen that projects a 3D image of the light-rail's conductor. (The projection shows an animated human-like male face, in a conductor's uniform, with a cap.) The Conductor is an AI with limited intelligence and an eccentric personality, and in this scene the player chats with the Conductor. The Conductor retains a memory of previous passengers and events on the light-rail, and is a bit traumatised (in a glitchy, AI sort of way) by something troubling that happened on Celebration Day. This was a ship-wide event that took place in the Biome to mark a hundred years into the mission. That was the day the Black Spots attacked the ship, and a portion of them travelled via the light-rail.

The scene is supposed to unfold as follows. The Conductor makes his standard announcement to welcome boarding passengers, but there are hints of his nervous disposition even in this little speech. Then he displays a list of potential destinations: 1) Lower deck Security Checkpoint, 2) Biodome, 3) Science Deck, 4) Upper Decks, 5) Captain’s Quarters. The player asks for one of the listed destinations. But in fact all five of them are problematic, and whichever one the player picks, the Conductor jitteringly, nervously, gives an excuse for why they can't go there.

Here are the sorts of excuses the Conductor gives. We'll go through the five possible destinations one at a time. 1) If the player chooses the Security Checkpoint, the Conductor bluntly informs them that is is under construction. 2) If the player chooses the Biodome (i.e. the Biome, which the Conductor likes to think of as "a slittle slice of nature", and a place of relaxation,), this triggers a kind-of PTSD in the Conductor, because that's where the Black Spots caused so much trouble on Celebration Day. So he refuses to go there so as not to spoil the vibe. 3) If the player chooses the Science Deck (where "the greatest minds of our time push the boundaries of humanity and light, according to the Condcutor), the Coductor declines because of unforeseen and unpreventable damage (maybe alluding to the Blacks Spots' attack again). 4) If the player chooses the Upper Decks (where the ship's wealthier passengers live), the Conductor adopts a snooty air, and refuses without clearly explaining why (although it's obvious he thinks the Player isn't classy enough to go there). 5) Finally, if the player chooses the Captain's Quarters, the Conductor informs the player it's invitation only.
