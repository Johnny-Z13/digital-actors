Eliza: So your pod id tells me you're a zoologist. That might be helpful for our terraforming mission, but with the fleet malfunctioning you need to find a bona fide engineer.
Eliza: Activating your eye-OS implant so you can scan the room for an engineer in stasis. Hang on, this won't take long.
Eliza: Did it work? You should be seeing a sort of advanced visual interface.
Player: Yeah, I see it.  Stasis pods everywhere.  Got it.
Eliza: Excellent. Now, use the command "Luna Scan" to get the pod IDs.  We need to find an engineer, quickly.
Player: Luna Scan.
Eliza: Okay, good.  I see you've found John Lusty.  What's his pod ID?
Computer: WRONG ID
Player: ED 3122
Computer: ENGINEER ID
Eliza: Right, attempting to wake him now… Wait, what’s that?  I’m getting some kind of warning signal from his pod…
