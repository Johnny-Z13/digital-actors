[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

[Dean]:  I'll say! Ronnie, you were like some kinda Shakespearean ninja! 

[Ronald]: (Chuckles)  **"Yo, man, this ain't Shakespeare. This is Cedar Rapids, baby!"** 

[Joan]: (Nervously laughing)  **"I... I think I just peed my pants a little."** 

[Dean]:  That makes two of us, sweetheart. 

[Tim]:  Shakespearean ninja?  Did he just say Shakespearean ninja? 

[Ronald]: Shakespeare in the streets, Sun Tzu in the sheets, baby.  It's all good. 

[Dean]: You sure showed them, Ronnie! Who knew you had it in you? 

[Ronald]: (Smiling slightly)  Let's just say, a brother's got to have a few hidden talents. 

[Tim]: Hidden talents? You were like Liam Neeson in Taken! 

[Ronald]:  Liam Neeson wishes he had these moves, son. 

[Dean]:  Moves like Jagger!  Except, you know, more...threatening. 

[Tim]:  I think I need to throw up. 

[Joan]:  The window's down, Tim! 

**[Tim]:  I don't think that's gonna help, Joan. My lunch is long gone. ** 

**[Dean]: Well, hopefully it landed on one of those banjo-strumming hillbillies.** 

**[Ronald]:  Look, man, just focus on your breathing.  Deep breaths. In through the nose, out through the mouth. That's it.  Just like yoga.** 

**[Tim]: Yoga? You think I'm gonna sit here and do fucking yoga after all that?** 

**[Dean]:  Relax, man, it's not like he's asking you to bend a pretzel. Just breathe.** 

**[Ronald]:  Pretzel logic is what got us into this mess in the first place, Dean.**
