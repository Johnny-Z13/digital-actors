Somehow Tim, Dean, Ronald, and Joan (another convention attendee) ended up at a party in a run-down farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. The other party-goers were all rednecks, drunks, and low-life, small time criminals. There was drug-taking, lots of drink, and an air of impending violence. Tim insulted one of the party-goers, who beat him up. But Ronald intervened, pretending he was a gangster carrying a weapon. He managed to intimate the crowd into letting them all go. Now they are all in their car, driving away from the party at high speed. Ronald tries to calm Tim down. They all try to understand what just happened. Ronald explains that he used his community theatre training to sound badass.
