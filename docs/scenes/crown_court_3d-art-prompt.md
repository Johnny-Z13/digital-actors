## Production Notes

### Optimization Priorities
1. Judge's bench must be prominent, elevated (authority and focus)
2. Jury box must show 12 distinct individuals (player's audience)
3. Defense table is player's workspace - needs detail, readable documents
4. Wood paneling creates formal atmosphere - texture and finish critical
5. Natural window light creates appropriate formal daylight ambiance

### Character Details
- **Judge:** Female, late 50s, reading glasses, black robes with red accents, stern but fair
- **Daniel Price (Defendant):** Male, 34, hollow-eyed, terrified, hands clasped, sitting behind defense table
- **Jurors:** 12 varied individuals, mixed ages/genders/expressions, period clothing
- **Bailiff/Court Officers:** Formal uniforms, standing positions

### Sound Design Cues (Visual Integration)
- Gavel: visible on judge's bench
- Murmuring crowd: public gallery visible
- Paper shuffle: documents on tables
- Door close: heavy wooden doors at rear
- Footsteps: polished hard floors

### Avoid
- ❌ American courtroom style (flags, modern design)
- ❌ Modern technology (screens, projectors, tablets)
- ❌ Casual/informal atmosphere (must be formal, imposing)
- ❌ Bright theatrical lighting (natural daylight, formal fixtures)
- ❌ Empty courtroom (must show jury, judge, observers)
