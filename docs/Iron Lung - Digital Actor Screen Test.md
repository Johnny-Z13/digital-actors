# **DIGITAL ACTOR SCREEN TEST — ONE PAGER**

## **Title**

**IRON LUNG**

## **Purpose**

Demonstrate a **voice-driven survival experience** where emotional trust between the player and an unseen NPC is a **mechanical requirement for success**, not just narrative flavour.  
Showcases: emotional dialogue, trust-based decision making, counterintuitive action, time pressure, and consequence.

Length: **3–5 minutes**  
Format: **Single scene, two humans (one unseen), voice-first, limited locomotion**

**Scene & Setting**

**Fade up from black.**

Interior of a **two-man submersible** at depth.  
Cramped, industrial, under strain.

The player can move slightly within the forward cabin.

A wall-mounted gauge reads:

**OXYGEN: 03:00**

Power is degraded.

A voice comes over an internal intercom.

**NPC (strained, panicked, human):**

“I’m in the engine compartment at the rear. I can’t get to you, but I’m here. We are running out of oxygen\! We need to work together and act fast\!\! You’re gonna have to trust me\!\!”

They are in the same vessel.  
Same oxygen supply.   
Same risk.

## **Emotional Bond Design** 

The NPC is:

* physically present but unseen

* sharing the same air, the same countdown

* emotionally vulnerable, not authoritative

Trust is built when the player:

* responds verbally to reassurance or fear

* acknowledges uncertainty out loud

* follows guidance that may contradict instinct

The NPC explicitly asks for **trust-based actions**.

## **Interaction Model**

* Player **talks naturally** with the NPC via intercom.

* Player **operates sub controls** in the forward cabin.

* NPC operates inaccessible systems in the engine room.

* Some systems require **coordinated actions**.

Silence, doubt, or refusal is acknowledged emotionally.

## **Trust Mechanics**

Trust is tracked implicitly through behaviour, not meters.

The NPC may ask the player to:

* **temporarily shut off oxygen flow** to reroute pressure

* **vent a compartment**, increasing panic but enabling recovery

* **delay an obvious fix** while they complete a risky task

If the player:

* verbally commits (“I trust you. Do it.”)

* follows through without overriding

* stays engaged during moments of discomfort

The system rewards trust with **temporary oxygen stabilisation** or a **time buffer**.

Distrust (interrupting, overriding, refusing) removes these opportunities.

## **Conversational Spine**

**Opening — Shared Reality**  
NPC confirms they’re trapped together.  
Establishes emotional baseline.

**Middle — Counterintuitive Choices**  
NPC asks for actions that feel wrong.  
Player must decide whether to trust.

**Escalation — Mutual Dependence**  
NPC takes risks on the player’s behalf.  
Player actions directly affect NPC survival.

**Resolution — Outcome**  
Survival or death is shared.

## **Success Criteria / End States**

The scene completes when **oxygen reaches zero** or **airflow is restored**.

### **Ending 1 : Failure (No Trust)**

Player refuses counterintuitive actions or overrides NPC guidance.

* Oxygen drains

* NPC’s voice fades mid-sentence

**Fade to black.**

### **Ending 2 : Survival (Partial Trust)**

Player follows basic guidance but avoids risky trust actions.

* Oxygen stabilises briefly

* Systems remain degraded

* NPC survives, but unresolved

Survival without closure.

### **Ending 3 : Survival (Full Trust)**

Player commits to counterintuitive actions and verbally affirms trust.

* Temporary oxygen boost triggered

* Systems fully recover

* NPC confirms success from engine room

**NPC (relieved):**

“You trusted me. That’s what saved us.”

## **Final Beat**

Oxygen gauge steadies.  
The Intercom remains open.

The NPC stays on the line.

Scene ends.
