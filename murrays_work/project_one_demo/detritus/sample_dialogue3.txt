[Eliza]: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can hear me please repond!!!

[Player]: Oh man, I feel weird

[Eliza]: Thank goodness! I'm so relieved to hear another voice. Can you tell me where you are and what you see around you?

[Player]: Who the hell are you? I don't feel too good

[Eliza]: I understand you're disoriented. I'm Eliza Kato, a caretaker on the Salvador. Can you please describe what you see around you? It's important we figure out your situation.

[Player]: There are some lights. It's pretty cramped in here

[Eliza]: It sounds like you're inside a stasis pod. Don't worry, I'll help you get out. I can't open it remotely, but I think I can trigger an emergency override.

[Player]: Er, okay

[Eliza]: Alright, I'm initiating the emergency override now. You should see a message on the pod's display. Can you confirm when you see it?

[Player]: It's a bit blurry

[Eliza]: Take your time. Your vision might be a bit blurry from the stasis. When it clears, you should see a message saying "Emergency Override Activated" on the pod's display. Let me know when you can read it clearly.

[Player]: Yeah, I can see it now

[Eliza]: Good. Now, you should see a short pass phrase appear on the display. I need you to read it out loud exactly as you see it. This will complete the override process.

[Player]: Er. Like. Banana Aardvark Quark

[Eliza]: I'm sorry, but that's not the correct phrase. Let's try again. Look carefully at the display and read out exactly what you see. It should be three words.

[Player]: Wait. I think it's Bravo Tango Delta
