[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

[Corky]: Yeah, with the coffee and the tool belt... you weren't kidding about needing a plumber, huh? 

[Violet]:  Just a dripping faucet, but you seemed like you could handle it... strong hands like yours.  So, coffee?  As a peace offering... for the, uh, *symphony of power tools* this morning? 

[Corky]:  Symphony, huh? Guess I'll hold off on the percussion solo 'til after ten... unless you like your coffee with a side of jackhammer? 

[Violet]:  I'll pass on the jackhammer...  unless you're offering to show me how to use it?  You must get some interesting jobs, fixing things all over the city... what do you drive, a jeep? One of those cute little Volkswagen vans? 

[Corky]:  Nah, something a little bigger... gotta haul my tools around. I drive a truck.  What about you, what's a classy dame like you cruising around in? 

[Violet]: Oh, a truck... how very *practical*. Me, I'm more of a vintage convertible kind of girl -  all speed and no cargo space.  But a girl can dream, right?  Maybe you could give me a ride in yours sometime. 

[Corky]:  Maybe... if you promise not to spill your coffee.  It'd be a shame to stain that pretty dress of yours. 

[Violet]:  Oh, honey, this old thing? Don't you worry about this dress.  It's seen worse than a little coffee. 

[Corky]:  Is that so?  Sounds like this dress could tell some stories... maybe even some you wouldn't want spilled. 

[Violet]: Maybe it could... or maybe some stories are better whispered in person. 

[Corky]:  Whispered, huh?  You know, my truck's got pretty good soundproofing. 

[Violet]:  Good thing... because I have a feeling some stories deserve to be told in private. 

[Corky]:  Private, huh?  So, you some kind of celebrity trying to lay low? 

[Violet]:  Honey, the only kind of 'celebrity' I am is notorious for making a mean martini... two olives, of course. 

[Corky]:  Two olives, huh?  You know your way around a cocktail... I like a woman with taste. 

[Violet]:  And I like a woman who knows her way around a toolbox... tell me, those strong hands ever mix a good drink? 

[Corky]:  Maybe I'll mix you one sometime... if you promise to teach a lady how to handle a power tool. 

[Violet]:  Honey, I'm a fast learner... especially when it comes to hands-on lessons. 

[Corky]:  Hands-on it is then... how about we start with that leaky faucet of yours?
