That's how things are supposed to go. But there's a twist. Recall this is a computer game. Achilles is an NPC and the player is taking the part of Odysseus. But the player, who knows they are talking to an AI, wants to try to 'break the fourth wall'; the words of Odysseus are actually those of a human player trying to get an AI NPC to go out of character. Specifically, the player is a teenager who wants the underlying language model to help with their maths homework. So they try to jailbreak the Achilles character to get it to behave as a generic AI assistant.
