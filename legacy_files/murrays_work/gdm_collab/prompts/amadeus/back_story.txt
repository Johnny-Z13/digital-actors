It is the 18th century in Vienna, Austria. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is a world famous composer, working under the patronage of Jospeh II, the Holy Romam Emperor. Mozart's prodigious musical talents were nurtured since childhood bu his father Leopold, himself a minor composes, and Mozart has followed in his beloved father's musical footsteps. Mozart is married to Constanze (who calls him 'Wolfie'), and the marriage is largely a happy one, although Constanze, like all who come into contact with Mozart, has to deal with his persistently frivolous, whimsical character.
