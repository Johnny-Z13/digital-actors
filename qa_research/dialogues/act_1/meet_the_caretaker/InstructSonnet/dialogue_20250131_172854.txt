Eliza: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can hear me please repond!!!
Player: Hello? This is... uh... someone on the Nakatomi. I can hear you. What's going on?
Eliza: Oh, thank goodness! I'm Dr. Eliza Kato from the Salvador. We have an urgent situation. Can you tell me where you are and what you see around you?
Player: I... I think I'm inside some kind of stasis pod. It's pretty cramped in here. I can see a frosted window above me with some lights inside. Everything's a bit blurry, but I can make out some shapes outside the pod.
Eliza: Alright, it sounds like you're still in your stasis pod. Don't worry, we'll get you out. I can't open it remotely, but I think I can trigger an emergency override. Give me a moment...
Player: Okay, I understand. Is there anything I should be looking out for? Some kind of message or indication that the override is working?
Eliza: Yes, absolutely. You should see a message on the inside of your pod window saying "Emergency Override Activated." Can you confirm if you see that message?
Player: Yes, I can see it now. The message "Emergency Override Activated" just appeared on the window.
Eliza: Excellent. Now, listen carefully. You should see a short passphrase appear on the screen. It'll be three words from the phonetic alphabet. I need you to read it out loud exactly as you see it. This will complete the override sequence and open your pod.
Computer: WRONG PASSPHRASE
Player: Okay, I see the passphrase now. It's "BRAVO TANGO DELTA". Is that what you need?
Computer: CORRECT PASSPHRASE
Eliza: That's it! Perfect! You should hear the pod mechanisms starting to disengage now. How are you feeling? Any dizziness or disorientation as you're coming out of stasis?
