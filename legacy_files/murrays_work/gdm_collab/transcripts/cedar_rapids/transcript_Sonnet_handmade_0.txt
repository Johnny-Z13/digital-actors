[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

[Ronald]: Yo, homie, we just bounced outta there like some straight-up G's, you feel me?
[Dean]: Holy shit, Ronald! Where'd you learn to talk like that? You just went full-on gangsta and saved our asses!
[Joan]: I can't believe it! Ronald, you were like a completely different person back there. Who knew you had that in you?
[Tim]: Ronald, you're like... a secret superhero or something! I thought I was gonna die back there, man!
[Ronald]: Nah, man, it's all good. Just some community theater skills comin' in clutch. Ain't no thang but a chicken wang, ya dig?
[Dean]: Well, slap my ass and call me Shirley! Ronald, you've been holding out on us. I think I just fell in love with your gangsta alter ego!
[Joan]: I don't know whether to be terrified or impressed. Ronald, remind me never to get on your bad side!
[Tim]: Guys, I think I'm gonna be sick. Is this what an out-of-body experience feels like? Ronald, can you teach me how to be badass like that?
[Ronald]: Tim, my man, being badass ain't about actin' tough. It's about stayin' cool under pressure. But right now, let's focus on gettin' you home safe, a'ight?
