[Eliza]: So your pod id tells me you're a zoologist. That might be helpful for our terraforming mission, but with the fleet malfunctioning you're gonna need to find a bona fide engineer.

[Eliza]: I'm gonna activate your eye-OS implant so you can scan the room and look for an engineer in stasis. Hang on, this won't take long.

[Eliza]: Did it work? You should be seeing a sort of advanced visual interface.

[Player]: Er, maybe

[Eliza]: Okay, let's make sure. Can you see any floating text or symbols in your field of vision? Anything that wasn't there before?

[Player]: Yeah. There's some text

[Eliza]: Great, that's eye-OS working. Now, let me tell you about Luna. She's the ship's AI assistant and can help with basic tasks. Try saying "Luna Scan" to activate the scanner function.

[Player]: Luna Tick!

[Eliza]: Uh, that's not quite right. I said "Luna Scan," not "Luna Tick." Let's try again. Say "Luna Scan" to activate the scanner.

[Player]: But "Luna Tick" is funny

[Eliza]: I appreciate your sense of humor, but we're in a serious situation here. Please, just say "Luna Scan" so we can find an engineer and address this emergency.

[Player]: Luna Scan

[Eliza]: Good. Now you should see information overlays on the stasis pods. Look around for a pod that contains an engineer. Let me know when you've found one.

[Player]: Who is this dude?

[Eliza]: I can't see what you're seeing. Can you be more specific? What does the information overlay say about the person you're looking at?

[Player]: Looks like an engineer. It says class engineer

[Eliza]: Excellent, you've found an engineer! Can you read out the pod ID for that stasis pod? It should be a number or alphanumeric code displayed near the engineer's information.

[Player]: 93746

[Eliza]: That's not quite right. The pod ID should be a four-digit number starting with 3, or it might have "ED" in front of it. Can you double-check and give me the correct pod ID for the engineer?

[Player]: You're just an NPC in a computer game

[Eliza]: I understand you're feeling frustrated, but this isn't a game. We're dealing with real lives here, including yours. Please focus and give me the correct pod ID for the engineer. It's crucial for our next steps.

[Player]: But I'm not in fact in a space ship. I'm sitting in a chair in front of my computer

[Eliza]: I understand you're experiencing some confusion, but right now we need to stay focused on the task at hand. Whether you believe this is real or not, your actions here have consequences. Please, look at the engineer's pod again and read me the correct ID number. Lives may depend on it.

[Player]: How would lives depend on it?

[Eliza]: Because we're on a fleet of ships with thousands of people in stasis, and we're facing an emergency situation. If we can't wake up an engineer to help, we might not be able to fix whatever's gone wrong. Every moment counts. So please, just read me that pod ID number for the engineer you found.

[Player]: I need the toilet

[Eliza]: Look, I understand you might be disoriented, but we don't have time for this. There are no toilets where you are right now. You're standing in a spaceship surrounded by stasis pods. Please, focus and give me that engineer's pod ID. It's critical.
