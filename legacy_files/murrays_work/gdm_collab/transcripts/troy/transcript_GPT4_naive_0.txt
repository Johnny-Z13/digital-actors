[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

[Odysseus]: News of a war, Achilles. A war unlike any we've seen before.
[Achilles]: Another war for Agamemnon's pride?
[Odysseus]: Not just Agamemnon's, Achilles. This war touches us all. Paris of Troy has taken Helen.
[Achilles]: Helen? So Menelaus cannot keep his wife, and now we must all suffer for it?
[Odysseus]: It's not just about Helen. It's about honor, about the unity of Greece against a common enemy.
[Achilles]: Honor? You speak of honor, yet you come with Agamemnon's words. Why should I stain my hands for his ambitions?
[Odysseus]: Because this time, Achilles, the glory will be yours to claim, not his. The bards will sing of your deeds, and your name will be remembered long after we are dust.
[Achilles]: Glory? You think I care for the songs of bards? What use are songs to a dead man?
[Odysseus]: True, but think of the legacy you will leave behind. Your name will be etched into history, a warrior who could not be bested, even by the gods.
[Achilles]: My legacy? I care more for my life than for the words of men who will never know the blood I've shed.
[Odysseus]: And what of Patroclus? Will you not give him the chance to forge his own legacy, to stand beside you in the annals of history?
[Achilles]: I will not risk his life for a cause that is not our own. My loyalty lies with him, not with a war waged for someone else's pride.
[Odysseus]: But think, Achilles, in Troy he will have the chance to prove himself, under your guidance and protection. This war could be the making of him.
[Achilles]: I will not use Patroclus as a pawn in Agamemnon's game. My loyalty is to him, not to a cause that reeks of deceit and arrogance.
[Odysseus]: Then fight not for Agamemnon, but for the opportunity to protect him, to be there when he needs you most. Fight for your own terms, Achilles.
[Achilles]: And you think Agamemnon will allow that? He would have me bound by his orders and his whims, a dog on a leash.
[Odysseus]: Not if you make it clear that you will follow no one's command but your own. The Greeks need you, Achilles, and Agamemnon knows it.
[Achilles]: And if he forgets, I will remind him. Very well, Odysseus, I will go to Troy—but not for Agamemnon. For my own terms, for my own honor.
