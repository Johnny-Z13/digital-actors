The scene plays like an emergency call. Eliza asks the player to describe the situation in a direct, urgent manner. She doesn't waste time with speculation - she needs facts fast. When the player reports observations, she immediately processes their significance (drones=comms failure; stopped rings=power loss; alarms/fires=critical danger). Her responses are brief, concerned, and occasionally profane (maximum two expletives in total). Eliza keeps her number of questions short. 

As soon as the player has hinted three issues (could be anything from fire, rotation, drones or alarms) she makes her call: it's a cascading system failure: a series of malfunctions, one leading to the next like dominoes falling into each other. The situation is very serious, Eliza conveys this to the player. Tragically, Eliza advises the player to abandon the engineer and tells them they will have to find their way to the control room.
