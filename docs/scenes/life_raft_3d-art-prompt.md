# World Labs 3D Generation Prompt: Life Raft (Escape Pod Interior)

## Scene Overview
Submarine escape pod compartment flooding at depth. Cramped cylindrical metal pod tilted at angle. Emergency lighting, water seeping in, two oxygen gauges showing unequal levels. Life-or-death survival atmosphere.

---

## Environment Description

Create the interior of a cramped submarine escape pod in emergency state. Cylindrical metal chamber, tilted due to damaged submarine, with water seeping through seals. Cold industrial survival environment - this is the last chance at life. Two oxygen gauges dominate the control panel, showing player vs. Captain's air supply disparity.

---

## Key Environmental Elements

### Pod Architecture
- **Shape:** Cylindrical chamber (6 feet diameter, 10-12 feet long)
- **Walls:** Curved riveted metal panels, industrial gray/blue
- **Tilt:** Pod angled due to submarine damage (creates disorienting perspective)
- **Ceiling:** Curved, pipes and conduits along length
- **Floor:** Metal deck with anti-slip texture, water pooling in low areas
- **Bulkhead:** Sealed door separating pod from forward control (heavy wheel lock, inaccessible)

### Central Control Panel (Hero Prop)
- **Location:** Facing player, wall-mounted at chest height
- **Style:** Military submarine aesthetic, analog + digital hybrid
- **Key Elements:**
  - **Two Oxygen Gauges (Side-by-Side):**
    - **Player Gauge (LEFT):** Green border, needle at 30%, decreasing
    - **Captain Gauge (RIGHT):** Red border, needle at 60%, slower decrease
    - Circular analog faces, clear numbers, backlit
    - Visual comparison is critical (shows Captain has more O2)
  - **Hull Integrity Gauge:** Horizontal bar or circular gauge, 0-100%
    - Starts at 80%, yellow-orange color
    - Transitions red as it drops below 40%
    - Warning lights flash at critical levels
  - **Control Buttons:**
    - O2 VALVE (green, glowing) - oxygen transfer
    - COMMS (blue, glowing) - communication channel
    - PREP POD (orange, appears Phase 4+)
    - DETACH (red, appears Phase 4+)
    - RISKY SAVE (magenta, appears Phase 5 conditionally)
- **Labels:** Military stencil lettering, some worn
- **Damage:** Minor - cracked indicator light, loose panel edge

### Critical Props
- **Porthole:** Small circular window (10-12 inches diameter)
  - Thick reinforced glass (2-3 inches)
  - View: Dark navy/black ocean water
  - Bioluminescent particles drifting past (optional)
  - Occasional bubbles rising (suggests air leaks)
  - Depth pressure visible - very dark, no surface light
- **Intercom Speaker:** Military mesh speaker unit, crackling with static (Captain Hale's voice)
- **Emergency Equipment:**
  - Fire extinguisher strapped to wall (red)
  - First aid kit (white with red cross)
  - Emergency breathing masks (hanging)
- **Straps/Harnesses:** Restraint straps on walls (suggest violent movement expected)
- **Warning Signs:** Stenciled hazard warnings, operating instructions

### Environmental Damage
- **Water Seepage:** Water dripping from ceiling seams, running down walls, pooling on floor
- **Condensation:** All metal surfaces show moisture droplets
- **Flooding Progress:** Water level slowly rising (ankle-deep pools)
- **Hull Groans:** Visual - metal panels slightly flexed, rivets stressed
- **Emergency State:** Everything suggests systems are failing

---

## Atmosphere & Mood

- **Claustrophobic** - tiny cylindrical space, no room to move
- **Tilted/Disorienting** - angle of pod creates unease
- **Cold and damp** - water everywhere, industrial chill
- **Emergency desperation** - time running out, systems failing
- **Isolation** - separated from Captain, bulkhead sealed
- **Life-or-death stakes** - this pod is last chance at survival
- **Utilitarian** - purely functional, zero comfort

---

## Lighting Specifications

### Primary Lighting
- **Emergency Floods:** Harsh amber emergency lighting
  - Ceiling-mounted, directional
  - Flickering suggests power instability
  - Creates strong shadows in curved space

### Accent Lighting
- **Red Warning Strips:** LED strips along ceiling perimeter (constant emergency state)
- **Gauge Backlighting:**
  - Player gauge: Soft green glow
  - Captain gauge: Soft red glow
  - Hull integrity: Yellow-orange (transitions to red at critical)
- **Control Button Illumination:** Each button glows its color (green, blue, orange, red, magenta)
- **Porthole Ambient:** Faint deep blue from ocean (minimal light)

### Atmospheric Effects
- **Water Reflections:** Light bouncing off pooled water on floor
- **Condensation Scatter:** Light scattering through moisture in air
- **Flickering:** Occasional power surge causes lighting instability

### Color Temperature
- **Amber Emergency:** ~2800K (harsh, industrial)
- **Red Warnings:** Pure red emergency LEDs
- **Gauge Glow:** Green/red backlight (cool colors)
- **Ocean Blue:** Deep cold blue (~8000K+)

---

## Camera Specifications

### Primary Viewing Angle
- **Position:** First-person, trapped in pod facing control panel
- **Height:** Seated or crouched (~4 feet from floor)
- **Tilt:** Camera matches pod angle (creates disorientation)
- **Look Direction:** Facing control panel, can turn to view porthole/bulkhead

### Movement
- **Static position** - player cannot move (trapped in survival position)
- **Look around:** 360-degree rotation (limited by cramped space)
- **Slight sway:** Optional subtle motion suggesting water movement/pressure shifts

### Field of View
- **FOV:** 70-80 degrees (realistic, enhances claustrophobia)
- **Depth of Field:** Control panel sharp focus, background slightly soft

### Framing Goals
- Two oxygen gauges prominent (central gameplay element)
- Control panel dominates view (player's interface)
- Porthole visible to side (connection to ocean/depth)
- Water seepage visible overhead (environmental threat)
- Bulkhead door visible (blocked exit, separation from Captain)

- **Oxygen gauges:** 12 inches diameter each (prominent)
- **Porthole:** 10-12 inches diameter, glass 2-3 inches thick

- Water as constant danger
- Isolation and entrapment themes

### Artistic Style
- **Realistic military industrial** - authentic submarine design

## Production Notes

### Optimization Priorities
1. **Two oxygen gauges** are central gameplay element - must be prominent, readable
2. Tilted pod perspective creates disorientation (critical for atmosphere)
3. Water effects (drips, pools, reflections) add urgency
4. Control panel is hero prop - highest detail budget
5. Porthole view reinforces depth and isolation

### Visual Storytelling
- **Oxygen disparity** visible on gauges (Captain sacrificing for player)
- **Water rising** shows time running out
- **Sealed bulkhead** shows separation/isolation
- **Emergency lighting** shows systems failing
- **Cramped space** shows this is last resort (pod not meant for comfort)

### Avoid
- ❌ Spacious/comfortable layout (must be cramped survival space)
- ❌ Calm/stable atmosphere (emergency state, failing systems)
- ❌ Clean/new equipment (worn, military surplus aesthetic)
- ❌ Bright lighting (harsh emergency floods only)
- ❌ Level perspective (tilt is important for disorientation)
