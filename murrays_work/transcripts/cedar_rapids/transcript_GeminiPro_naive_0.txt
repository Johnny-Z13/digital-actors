[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

Ronald:  I have *no* idea, man, but did you SEE that guy's FACE? 

Ronald:  When I told him I was gonna drop him like third period French? Priceless! 

Ronald:  He totally bought it! 

Dean:  You were amazing, man! Like De Niro!  

Joan:  Totally!  Method acting!  You were ROBBED!

Ronald:  I know, right?  

Ronald:  It was like I was channeling De Niro!

Ronald:  Or maybe Christopher Walken! 

Ronald: A little bit of Pacino, even. 

Ronald:  De Niro meets Walken meets Pacino!   

Ronald:  They should make a movie about it! 

Ronald:  Starring me, obviously!

Ronald:  Directed by Tarantino! 

Ronald:  We could call it... "Farmhouse Frenzy"! No, wait... "Farmhouse of Fear"! 

Ronald:  No, no, no... I got it!  "Farmhouse Fury"!  Yeah!  That's the one! 

Ronald:  It'll be HUGE!  

Ronald:  We'll be swimming in Oscars! 

Ronald:  Think I can get away with wearing sunglasses to the ceremony? 

Tim:  Dude, I think you actually might.
