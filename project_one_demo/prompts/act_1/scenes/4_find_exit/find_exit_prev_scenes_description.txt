This is scene 4 of act 1 of the game. The player is still on one of the decks of the Nakatomi. The deck curves up and away, shaped as a huge arc, and a little further away is a great, round void within the craft. There is currently a serious emergency. The deck is full of stasis pods, but many are on fire. A slow, pulsing red light fills the space, and a low, regular klaxon is sounding. The floor is littered with broken, fallen droids. The player is in radio contact with Eliza on the Salvador, who is trying to help them remotely.

Previously in the game, the player woke up in a stasis pod on the same deck, was helped out of it by Eliza. She then activated eye-OS, a sort of advanced visual interface that allows the player to see information on a heads-up display, and to issue various verbal commands to Luna, the ship's AI assistant Luna. (Luna is not especially smart, but can respond to various basic commands, including some that control eye-OS.) The player tried to wake up an engineer (John Lusty) with Eliza's help. But the engineer's pod caught fire, and that seemed to trigger the current emergency. Tragically, the player was forced to abandon the engineer, and Eliza's task now is to help the player find the control room.
