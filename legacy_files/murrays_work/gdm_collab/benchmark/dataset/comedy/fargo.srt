I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:48,405
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

6
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:49,573
Yeah.

7
00:03:49,782 --> 00:03:50,866
Shep Proudfoot said...

8
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,119
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?

9
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:55,954
Shep said 8:30.

10
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:57,224
We've been sitting here an hour.

11
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,957
He's peed three times already.

12
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,043
I'm sure sorry. Shep told me 8:30.

13
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:04,296
It was a mix-up, I guess.

14
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,630
You got the car?

15
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:06,965
Yeah. You bet.

16
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,676
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new, burnt umber Cierra.

17
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,220
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down, then.

18
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:14,139
I'm Carl Showalter.

19
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:16,433
This is my associate, Gaear Grimsrud.

20
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:17,934
Yeah. How you doing?

21
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,479
So, we all set on this thing, then?

22
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:22,355
Sure, Jerry. We're all set.
Why wouldn't we be?

23
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,815
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.

24
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,233
Shep vouched for you and all.

25
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:28,153
I got every confidence here
in you fellas.

26
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:35,118
I guess that's it, then.

27
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:36,244
Here are the keys.

28
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:37,621
No, that's not it, Jerry.

29
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:38,747
Huh?

30
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,208
The new vehicle plus $40,000.

31
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,877
Yeah, but the deal was the car first,

32
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,255
then the 40,000,
like as if it was the ransom.

33
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,423
I thought Shep told you.

34
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:50,050
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

35
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:51,176
Well, okay...

36
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,428
Except that you
were gonna be here at 7:30.

37
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:55,096
Yeah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

38
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,681
Yeah, you already said that.

39
00:04:56,766 --> 00:05:00,352
Yeah, but it's not
a whole pay-in-advance deal.

40
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:04,606
See, I give you a brand-new vehicle
in advance, and then...

41
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,191
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

42
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:07,275
Okay.

43
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,444
I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

44
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:10,570
I will say this, though.

45
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:13,323
What Shep told us
didn't make a whole lot of sense.

46
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:16,451
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

47
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:19,120
You want your own wife kidnapped.

48
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:20,247
Yeah.

49
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,291
You...

50
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:25,252
My point is,

51
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:28,171
you pay the ransom, what,
80,000 bucks?

52
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:32,133
I mean, you give us half the ransom,
40,000, you keep half.

53
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:33,552
It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul.

54
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:34,803
It doesn't make any sense.

55
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:38,098
Okay, see,
it's not me paying the ransom.

56
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:41,059
The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.

57
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:42,853
Her dad, he's real well-off.

58
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:44,312
Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.

59
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:45,856
What kind of trouble you in, Jerry?

60
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,693
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

61
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:51,194
See, I just need the money.

62
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,405
Now, her dad, he's real well-off.

63
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:55,198
So, why don't you just ask him
for the money?

64
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:56,658
Or your fucking wife, you know?

65
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:58,159
Or your fucking wife, Jerry?

66
00:05:58,244 --> 00:05:59,452
Well...

67
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:02,289
It's all part of this...

68
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,959
They don't know I need it, see?

69
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:09,254
Okay, so there's that.
And even if they did, I wouldn't get it,

70
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:10,839
so there's that on top, then.

71
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:12,173
See, these are personal matters.

72
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:13,258
Personal matters?

73
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:16,261
Yeah, personal matters that needn't...

74
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:18,263
Okay, Jerry.

75
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:22,350
You're tasking us to perform this mission,
but you won't...

76
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:23,935
You won't...

77
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:28,732
Fuck it.
Let's take a look at that Cierra.

78
00:06:36,782 --> 00:06:37,949
Hon?

79
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,702
Hi, hon!
Welcome back!

80
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,621
How was Fargo?

81
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:44,372
Yeah, real good.

82
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:46,124
Dad's here.

83
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:51,671
<i>...leads the Badgers in goal production
with five this year.</i>

84
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:52,881
How you doing, Wade?

85
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:54,049
Yeah, pretty good.

86
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:55,133
What you watching there?

87
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:56,259
Gophers.

88
00:06:56,344 --> 00:06:57,719
Who they playing?

89
00:06:57,803 --> 00:06:58,845
Ooh!

90
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,187
Is he staying for supper, then?

91
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:08,980
Yeah. I think so.

92
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:10,690
- Dad?
- What?

93
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:12,067
Are you staying for supper?

94
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:13,276
Yeah.

95
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:21,993
May I be excused?

96
00:07:22,078 --> 00:07:23,078
You done there?

97
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:24,579
Uh-huh. I'm going out.

98
00:07:24,664 --> 00:07:26,414
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

99
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:27,666
Just McDonald's.

100
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,417
- Back at 9:30.
- Okay.

101
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,253
He just ate.
He didn't finish.

102
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:34,923
Going to McDonald's
instead of finishing here.

103
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:36,508
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

104
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:38,259
It's okay, McDonald's?

105
00:07:38,344 --> 00:07:40,136
What do you think they do there?

106
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:42,263
They don't drink milk shakes,
I assure you.

107
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:43,848
It's okay, Dad.

108
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:53,274
Wade, have you had a chance
to think about

109
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:54,859
that deal I was talking about,

110
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:56,611
those 40 acres there, in Wayzata?

111
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:58,113
You told me about it.

112
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:00,115
Yeah, you said you'd have
to think about it.

113
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,616
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

114
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:04,619
It's a heck of a lot.
What did you say you were gonna put there?

115
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:05,996
A lot. It's a...

116
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,539
I know it's a lot.

117
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:08,790
I mean a parking lot.

118
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:11,876
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

119
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:13,795
Yeah, well, it's a chunk, but...

120
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,923
I had a couple lots, late 50's.
Lost a lot of money.

121
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:18,633
- A lot of money.
- Yeah, but the difference...

122
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:20,885
I thought you were gonna show it
to Stan Grossman.

123
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,221
He passes on this stuff
before it gets kicked up to me.

124
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:25,849
Well, Stan'll say, "No dice."
That's why you pay him.

125
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,934
I'm asking you here, Wade.

126
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:32,230
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

127
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,108
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

128
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:51,916
Where is Pancakes House?

129
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:54,169
What?

130
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:56,379
We stop at Pancakes House.

131
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,175
What are you, nuts?
We had pancakes for breakfast.

132
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:01,843
Gotta go to a place
where I can get a shot

133
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,511
and a beer and a steak, maybe.

134
00:09:03,596 --> 00:09:06,014
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

135
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,021
Oh, come on, man.

136
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:16,357
Okay. Here's an idea.

137
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:18,109
We can stop outside of Brainerd.

138
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:20,528
I know a place there where we can get laid.
What do you think?

139
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:22,530
I'm fucking hungry now, you know.

140
00:09:22,615 --> 00:09:26,284
Yeah, yeah, Jesus.
I'm saying we can stop, get pancakes,

141
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:28,787
and then we'll get laid, all right?

142
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:39,047
<i>Lou Diamond, line one.</i>

143
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,134
We sat right here in this room

144
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:44,677
and went over this and over this.

145
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:45,804
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

146
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:48,807
I sat right here and said
I didn't want any TruCoat.

147
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:50,892
Yeah, but I'm saying that TruCoat.

148
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:52,977
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

149
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:54,562
It'll cost you a heck
of a lot more than $500.

150
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:55,730
You're sitting there.

151
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:56,856
You're talking in circles.

152
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,793
You're talking like
we didn't go over this already.

153
00:09:58,859 --> 00:09:59,943
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

154
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:02,153
We had a deal here for 19,500.

155
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:03,947
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

156
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:05,740
you'd get me this car,
these options,

157
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,742
without the sealant, for 19,500.

158
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:09,285
All right, I'm not saying I didn't.

159
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,912
You called me 20 minutes ago and said

160
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:12,705
you had it ready to make delivery.

161
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,415
You says,
"Come on down and get it."

162
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,628
And here you are, and you're wasting
my time and my wife's time,

163
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:21,631
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

164
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:23,716
All right.

165
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:26,344
I'll talk to my boss.

166
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:31,808
See, they install that TruCoat
at the factory.

167
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:35,311
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

168
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:38,648
These guys here.
These guys.

169
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:42,527
It's always the same.
It's always more.

170
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,491
You going to the Gophers on Sunday?

171
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:50,076
Oh, you betcha.

172
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:52,537
You wouldn't have an extra ticket?

173
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:54,998
You kidding?

174
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:57,917
Well...

175
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:02,463
he never done this before,

176
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:05,300
but seeing as
it's special circumstances and all,

177
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:08,303
he says I can knock $100 off that TruCoat.

178
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:11,431
100?

179
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:14,475
You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.

180
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,311
You're a bald-faced liar.

181
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:18,021
Bucky, please.

182
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:20,690
A fucking liar.

183
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:22,275
Bucky, please.

184
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:24,903
Where's my goddamn checkbook?

185
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:26,613
Let's get this over with.

186
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:29,240
Where is it?

187
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:08,446
<i>From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, starring...</i>

188
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,867
I am talking about your potential.

189
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:13,952
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,663
You're not a C student.

191
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:18,081
Yeah.

192
00:12:18,374 --> 00:12:20,500
Yet you're getting C grades.

193
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:23,878
It's that disparity there
that concerns your dad and me.

194
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:24,963
Uh-huh.

195
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:27,382
You know what a disparity is?

196
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,508
Yeah!

197
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:30,718
Okay! Well, that's why we...

198
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:33,096
We don't want you going out for hockey.

199
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,514
Oh, man!

200
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:36,516
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just an hour...

201
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:38,393
Hold on.

202
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:39,727
What's the big deal?

203
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:40,895
Hello?

204
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,772
<i>- Yeah, hiya, hon.
- Oh, hi, Dad.</i>

205
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:43,940
<i>Is Jerry around?</i>

206
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:45,900
Yeah. Hon!
Yeah, he's here.

207
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:47,235
Yeah, I'll catch him for you.

208
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:48,444
- Hon!
- Yeah?

209
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,113
- It's Dad.
- Okay.

210
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:52,156
Look, Dad, there's no fucking way...

211
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:53,241
Scotty!

212
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,660
Hey, let's watch that language there.

213
00:12:55,744 --> 00:12:56,911
How you doing there, Wade?

214
00:12:56,996 --> 00:12:58,079
<i>What's going on there?</i>

215
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,540
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

216
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:02,667
<i>Stan Grossman looked at your proposal.</i>

217
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:04,043
<i>He says it's pretty sweet.</i>

218
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:05,128
No kidding?

219
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:06,421
<i>Might be interested.</i>

220
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:10,842
No kidding?
I'd need the cash pretty quick there,

221
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:12,427
in order to close the deal.

222
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:14,137
<i>Come by at 2:30.
We'll talk about it.</i>

223
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:17,265
<i>If your numbers are right,
Stan says it's pretty sweet.</i>

224
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:19,183
<i>- Stan, you know, Grossman.
- Yeah.</i>

225
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:20,268
<i>2:30.</i>

226
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:21,477
Yeah. Okay.

227
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,119
Say, Shep, how you doing there?

228
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:40,121
Say, you know those two fellas

229
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:41,873
you put me in touch
with up there in Fargo?

230
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:43,624
I put you in touch with Grimsrud.

231
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,418
Yeah, well, he had a buddy there.

232
00:13:45,502 --> 00:13:46,688
He...
Then I don't vouch for him.

233
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:47,837
Well, that's okay.

234
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:50,131
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

235
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:51,799
Carl something.

236
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:53,329
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

237
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:56,346
Well, that's okay.
He's a buddy of the guy you vouched for,

238
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,847
so I'm not worried. I just...

239
00:13:57,931 --> 00:14:00,350
I was wondering, see,
I got to get in touch with him.

240
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:04,354
See, this deal I needed him for,
I may not need it anymore.

241
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,397
- Something's happening, see.
- Call him up.

242
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:09,901
Yeah, well, see, I did that,
and I haven't been able to get him,

243
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:13,154
so I thought maybe you'd know
an alternate number, or what have you.

244
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,238
Nope.

245
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:16,157
Okay. Well...

246
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,742
Real good, then.

247
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:40,431
Can you crack a fucking window open, man?

248
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:46,270
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

249
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:48,356
You know, a cancer agent.

250
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,276
Hey, look at that.
Twin Cities.

251
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:53,945
That's the IDS Building,
the big glass one.

252
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:59,075
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest
after the Sears in Chicago,

253
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,786
or John Hancock building, whatever.

254
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,414
You ever been to Minneapolis?

255
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:05,623
No.

256
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,711
Would it kill you to say something?

257
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:12,547
I did.

258
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:16,968
"No." That's the first thing you've said
in the last four hours.

259
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:18,803
That's a...

260
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:21,472
That's a fountain of conversation, man.

261
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:23,224
That's a geyser.

262
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:26,102
I mean, whoa, daddy.
Stand back, man.

263
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:29,063
Shit.

264
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:30,898
I'm sitting here driving.

265
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,358
I'm doing all the driving, man,

266
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:34,152
whole fucking way from Brainerd, driving.

267
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:36,946
Just trying to chat.

268
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,615
You know, keep our spirits up,

269
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,812
fight the boredom of the road,

270
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:45,037
and you can't say one fucking thing
just in the way of conversation?

271
00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:49,167
Oh, fuck it.
I don't have to talk either, man.

272
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:51,043
See how you like it.

273
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:56,841
Just total fucking silence.

274
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:59,302
Two could play at that game, smart guy.

275
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:01,679
We'll just see how you like it.

276
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:05,725
Total silence.

277
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:11,397
<i>Mr. Lundegaard,
this is Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.</i>

278
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:12,607
<i>How are you this morning?</i>

279
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:13,983
Real good. How you doing?

280
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,485
<i>Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.</i>

281
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:17,612
<i>You're damn hard to get
on the phone.</i>

282
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:20,114
It's pretty darn busy here,
but that's the way we like it.

283
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,240
<i>Well, that's for sure.</i>

284
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,242
<i>Now, I just need on these last,</i>

285
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:25,369
<i>these financing documents
that you sent us,</i>

286
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:27,622
<i>I can't read the serial numbers
of the vehicles.</i>

287
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:28,998
Yeah, but I already got the...

288
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:30,500
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

289
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,335
I already got the...
What? The...

290
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:33,669
<i>Yeah, the 320,000.</i>

291
00:16:33,754 --> 00:16:35,213
<i>You got the money last month.</i>

292
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:36,672
Yeah, so we're all set, then.

293
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:38,966
<i>Yeah, but the vehicles
that you're borrowing on,</i>

294
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:41,969
<i>I just can't read the serial numbers
on your application.</i>

295
00:16:42,054 --> 00:16:43,221
<i>Maybe if you could just read...</i>

296
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:44,347
Yeah, but the deal's already done.

297
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:45,556
I already got the money.

298
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:47,099
<i>Yes, but if we have an audit here,</i>

299
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:48,559
<i>I just have to know that these vehicles</i>

300
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:49,977
<i>you're financing with this money,</i>

301
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:51,354
<i>that they really exist.</i>

302
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:53,648
Yeah, well, they exist, all right.

303
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:55,399
<i>I'm sure they do,</i>

304
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:58,861
<i>but I can't read the serial numbers here,
so if you could read me...</i>

305
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:01,906
Yeah, but... See...

306
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:03,783
I don't have them in front of me.

307
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,326
Why don't I just fax you over a copy?

308
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,994
<i>No, well, no, fax is no good.</i>

309
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,080
<i>That's what I have,
and I can't read the darn thing.</i>

310
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:11,916
Yeah, okay. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

311
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,336
<i>Okay, because if I can't correlate
this note with the specific vehicles,</i>

312
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,463
<i>then I got to call back that money.</i>

313
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:18,923
Yeah, how much money was that?

314
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:21,926
<i>320,000.
I got to correlate that money</i>

315
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,469
<i>with the cars it's being lent on.</i>

316
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:25,680
Yeah. Okay, no problem.
I'll just fax that right over.

317
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:26,764
<i>No, no, no. Fax...</i>

318
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:28,599
I mean, send it over.
I'll shoot it right over to you, then.

319
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:29,809
<i>Okay, okay. Fine.</i>

320
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:31,769
Okay. Real good, then.

321
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:40,111
<i>- We're back with Katie Carlson.
- Hi.</i>

322
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:41,237
<i>Now, before we get going here,</i>

323
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,322
<i>we just want to remind
all of our viewers at home</i>

324

<i>Katie and I,
along with Twin City Travel,</i>

326
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:50,538

327
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:52,415
<i>It's a terrific time.
I know you've heard about it.</i>

328
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:55,751
<i>We want all of you to come with...</i>

329
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:57,461
<i>and that's the truth.</i>

330
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:01,173
<i>Okay, now, for those of you
that just joined us,</i>

331
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:02,717
<i>Katie here, this morning,
is going to show us</i>

332
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:05,886
<i>how to make Holidazzle eggs ourselves,

333
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:07,805
<i>- Now, Katie, I gotta admit...
- What?</i>

334
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,391
<i>I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.</i>

335
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:11,475
<i>Right.</i>

336
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:12,560
<i>This is an empty egg.</i>

337
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:13,853
<i>That's right, Dale.</i>

338
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:14,937
<i>Well, how do you get the egg...</i>

339
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,230
<i>- There was an egg in here, right?
- Yeah.</i>

340
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:19,150
<i>Okay, well, I don't...
How do you... I mean, you don't have</i>

341
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:22,194
<i>an empty chicken somewhere
that lays empty eggs?</i>

342
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,321
<i>No, no.</i>

343
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:25,990
<i>I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...</i>

344
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:42,256
Unguent.

345
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:43,341
What?

346
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:45,176
I need unguent.

347
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:52,767
No.

348
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:01,901
No...

349
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:26,384
You want to do it?

350
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:27,677
Push.

351
00:20:27,446 --> 00:20:29,697
- How are you, Stan?
- How you doing, Wade?

352
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:31,699
Good to see you again, Jerry.

353
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:34,368
If these numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

354
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:35,870
Those numbers are right, all right.

355
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:36,996
Believe me.

356
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,205
This is doable.

357
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,540
Congratulations, Jer.

358
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:41,500
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

359
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:44,670
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

360
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:46,505
Huh?

361
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:49,300
The financials are pretty thorough,

362
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:52,261
so the only thing we don't know
is your fee.

363
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:53,721
My fee?

364
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:56,390
Wade, what the heck
are you talking about?

365
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:57,850
Stan and I are okay.

366
00:20:57,934 --> 00:20:59,769
- Yeah.
- We're good to load in.

367
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:01,270
Yeah.

368
00:21:01,354 --> 00:21:04,982
But we never talked about your fee
for bringing it to us.

369
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:07,401
No, but, Wade, see,
I was bringing you this deal

370
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:08,931
for you to loan me the money to put in.

371
00:21:08,987 --> 00:21:10,863
It's my deal here, see.

372
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:15,201
Jerry, we thought you were bringing us
an investment.

373
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:16,494
Yeah. Right.

374
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:18,454
You're saying...

375
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:20,122
What are you saying?

376
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:21,457
You're saying we put in all the money,

377
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,958
and you collect when it pays off.

378
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:27,546
No, no. See...
But I'd...

379
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:30,257
I'd pay you back
the principal and interest.

380
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:33,010
Heck, I'd go one over prime?

381
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:34,512
We're not a bank, Jerry.

382
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:36,639
If I wanted bank interest on 750,000,

383
00:21:36,723 --> 00:21:39,725
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

384
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,143
- He's at North Star.
- He's at...

385
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:43,187
No, no. See, I...

386
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:47,066
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

387
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,693
Finder's fee is, what, 10%?

388
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:51,237
Heck, that's not gonna do it for me.

389
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:52,446
I need the principal.

390
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:55,783
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna
just give you $750,000.

391
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:57,284
What the heck were you thinking?

392
00:21:57,369 --> 00:21:58,661
If I'm only getting bank interest,

393
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:01,539
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

394
00:22:01,623 --> 00:22:03,082
I don't see nothing like that here.

395
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,708
Yeah, but I...

396
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:08,796
Okay. I...

397
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,631
I guarantee you your money back.

398
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:13,926
I'm not talking
about your damn word, Jerry.

399
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,219
Jeez!
What the heck are you...

400
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:17,012
We're not a bank, Jerry.

401
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:20,057
Well, look. I don't want
to cut you out of the loop,

402
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:22,518
but this here's a good deal.

403
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:24,937
I assume, if you're not interested,

404
00:22:25,021 --> 00:22:28,399
you won't mind
if we move on it independently.

405
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:30,628
Damn it!

406
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:03,118
Hon?

407
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:07,581
I got the groceries!

408
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,538
Yeah, Wade, hi.
It's Jerry. I...

409
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:53,544
Wade, it's Jerry.
I don't know what to do. It's Jean.

410
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:56,255
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

411
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:58,799
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

412
00:25:00,844 --> 00:25:04,013
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

413
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:08,809
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

414
00:25:08,893 --> 00:25:11,812
It's something... Jeez.
It's terrible.

415
00:25:22,157 --> 00:25:24,283
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

416
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:02,237
Shut the fuck up,

417
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:04,948
or I'll throw you back into the trunk,
you know.

418
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:08,285
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

419
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,920
Shit.

420
00:26:20,256 --> 00:26:21,757
Oh, the tags.

421
00:26:27,097 --> 00:26:29,473
All right, it's just the tags.

422
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:31,809
I never put my tags on the car.

423
00:26:33,812 --> 00:26:36,855
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

424
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:02,125
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

425
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:05,634
or else we're gonna have to,
you know, to shoot you.

426
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:15,936
Hey, I'll take care of this.

427
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:41,378
How can I help you, Officer?

428
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:52,848
This is a new car, then, sir?

429
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:55,934
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

430
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:59,479
You're required to display
temporary tags,

431
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:02,191
either in the plate area or taped
to the inside of the back window.

432
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:03,317
Certainly.

433
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:05,777
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

434
00:28:05,862 --> 00:28:07,237
Certainly.

435
00:28:10,158 --> 00:28:13,118
Yeah, I was gonna tape up those...
The tag.

436
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:17,831
You know, to be in full compliance,
but it must have...

437
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:20,000
It must have slipped my mind.

438
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,711
So maybe the best thing to do would be

439
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:25,255
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

440
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:28,467
What's this, sir?

441
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:31,345
My license and registration.

442
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,806
Yeah, I want to be in compliance.

443
00:28:36,643 --> 00:28:39,353
I was just thinking we could take care
of it right here,

444
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:40,896
in Brainerd.

445
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:49,905
Put that back in your pocket, please,

446
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:52,574
and step out of the car,
please, sir.

447
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,225
Shut the fuck up.

448
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:36,868
Whoa.

449
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:40,205
Whoa, daddy.

450
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:45,168
You'll take care of it.

451
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:51,425
You are smooth, smooth, you know?

452
00:29:53,177 --> 00:29:54,886
Oh, daddy.

453
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:58,890
Just clear him off the road.

454
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:00,934
Yeah.

455
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:56,174
No!

456
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:53,875
Oh, jeez.

457
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:01,216
Hi. It's Marge.

458
00:34:03,135 --> 00:34:04,678
Oh, my. Where?

459
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:06,846
Yeah?

460
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:09,558
Oh, jeez.

461
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:13,603
Okay. There in a jiff.

462
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:15,730
Real good, then.

463
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:26,575
You can sleep.
It's early yet.

464
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:28,118
Got to go?

465
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,327
Yeah.

466
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:32,122
I'll fix you some eggs.

467
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,749
It's okay, hon.
I gotta run.

468
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:37,294
You got to eat a breakfast, Marge.

469
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:41,131
I'll fix you some eggs.

470
00:34:42,174 --> 00:34:44,092
Hon, you can sleep.

471
00:34:44,468 --> 00:34:46,511
You gotta eat a breakfast.

472
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:51,933
I'll fix you some eggs.

473
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:54,227
Norm.

474
00:35:01,152 --> 00:35:03,320
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.

475
00:35:03,988 --> 00:35:05,071
Love you, Margie.

476
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:06,448
Love you, hon.

477
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:40,607
Hon?

478
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:41,691
Yeah?

479
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:43,526
Prowler needs a jump.

480
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:04,673
Hiya, Lou.

481
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,176
What you got there?

482
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:11,304
Margie, thought you might need
a little warm-up.

483
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:13,139
Thanks a bunch.

484
00:36:13,224 --> 00:36:14,474
So what's the deal now?

485
00:36:14,558 --> 00:36:15,809
Gary says triple homicide?

486
00:36:15,893 --> 00:36:17,143
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

487
00:36:17,228 --> 00:36:18,853
Two of them are over here.

488
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:20,814
Where is everybody?

489
00:36:20,898 --> 00:36:23,733
Well, it's cold, Margie.

490
00:36:25,945 --> 00:36:27,987
Watch your step, Margie.

491
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,749
Jeez. So...

492
00:36:40,376 --> 00:36:42,043
Jeez!

493
00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:44,045
Here's the second one!

494
00:36:45,214 --> 00:36:47,841
It's in the head and the hand there.

495
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,177
I guess that's a defensive wound.

496
00:36:51,262 --> 00:36:52,846
Oh, yeah?

497
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:55,974
Where's the state trooper?

498
00:36:56,058 --> 00:36:59,728
Back there a good piece,
in the ditch next to his prowler.

499
00:36:59,979 --> 00:37:01,187
Okay.

500
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:04,691
So we got a trooper pulls someone over.

501
00:37:04,775 --> 00:37:06,192
We got a shooting.

502
00:37:06,277 --> 00:37:07,694
These folks drive by.

503
00:37:07,778 --> 00:37:10,363
There's a high-speed pursuit,
ends here,

504
00:37:10,448 --> 00:37:12,699
and then this execution-type deal.

505
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:13,908
Yeah.

506
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:18,371
I'd be very surprised
if our suspect was from Brainerd.

507
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:19,622
Yeah.

508
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,042
And I'll tell you what.

509
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:26,212
From his footprint,
he looks like a big fella.

510
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:32,260
You see something down there, Chief?

511
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:35,138
No. I just think I'm gonna barf.

512
00:37:35,222 --> 00:37:36,347
Jeez.

513
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:38,892
You okay, Margie?

514
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:40,560
Yeah. I'm fine.

515
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:45,148
It's just morning sickness.

516
00:37:47,485 --> 00:37:49,152
Well, that passed.

517
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:50,320
Yeah?

518
00:37:50,404 --> 00:37:52,030
Yeah. Now I'm hungry again.

519
00:37:52,698 --> 00:37:54,741
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

520
00:37:54,825 --> 00:37:56,284
Oh, yeah.

521
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,869
Norm made some eggs.

522
00:37:57,953 --> 00:37:59,078
Yeah?

523
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:01,122
Well...

524
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,292
What now, do you think?

525
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:06,419
Let's go take a look at that trooper.

526
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,341
There's different footprints here, Lou.

527
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:12,467
Yeah?

528
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:15,220
Yeah. This guy's smaller than his buddy.

529
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:16,554
Oh, yeah?

530
00:38:17,348 --> 00:38:19,057
For Pete's sake.

531
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:20,517
How's it look, Marge?

532
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:23,603
Well, he's got his gun
on his hip there,

533
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:26,523
and he looks like a nice enough guy.

534
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,608
It's a real shame.

535
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:30,026
Yeah.

536
00:38:32,738 --> 00:38:34,489
Didn't monkey with his car there,
did you?

537
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:35,657
No way.

538
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:37,408
Well, somebody shut his lights.

539
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:38,868
I guess the little guy sat in there

540
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:40,286
waiting for his buddy to come back.

541
00:38:40,371 --> 00:38:41,955
Yeah, it would have been cold out here.

542
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:44,958
Heck, yeah.
You think is Dave open yet?

543
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:46,209
Dave?

544
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:48,711
You don't think he's mixed up in...

545
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:52,131
Oh, no, no. I just want to get Norm
some night crawlers.

546
00:38:54,844 --> 00:38:56,845
Did you look in his citation book?

547
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:02,141
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

548
00:39:02,226 --> 00:39:04,477
Under plate number he put "DLR."

549
00:39:04,562 --> 00:39:06,187
I figure they stopped him or shot him

550
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:09,315
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

551
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,902
So, I got the State looking for a Cierra
with a tag starting "DLR."

552
00:39:12,987 --> 00:39:15,071
They don't got no match yet.

553
00:39:16,073 --> 00:39:18,157
I'm not sure that I agree with you 100%

554
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:20,243
on your police work there, Lou.

555
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:21,661
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

556
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:25,498
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

557
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,375
"DLR."

558
00:39:29,712 --> 00:39:30,712
Oh.

559
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:33,840
Jeez.

560
00:39:35,426 --> 00:39:36,843
Say, Lou...

561
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:38,011
did you hear the one about the guy

562
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:39,637
who couldn't afford personalized plates,

563
00:39:39,722 --> 00:39:43,057
so he went and changed his name
to J3L-2404?

564
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:46,102
Yeah. That's a good one.

565
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,238
<i>Look, all's I know is, you got a problem,
you call a professional.</i>

566
00:39:57,323 --> 00:39:59,157
No. They said no cops.

567
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:00,992
They were darn clear on that, Wade.

568
00:40:01,076 --> 00:40:03,036
They said, "You call your cops,
and we're gonna shoot..."

569
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,537
Of course they're gonna say that.

570
00:40:04,622 --> 00:40:06,664
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

571
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:08,666
If I give these
sons of bitches $1 million,

572
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:10,543
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

573
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:11,628
Well, they...

574
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,754
$1 million is a lot of damn money.

575
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:14,547
Yeah, but... There they are.
They got my daughter.

576
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:16,132
Think this thing through here, Wade.

577
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:19,135
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

578
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:22,096
You got to listen to me
on this one, Wade.

579
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:23,973
Heck, you don't know.

580
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:26,059
You're just whistling Dixie here.

581
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:28,186
I'm saying the cops,
they can advise us on this.

582
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,520
I'm saying call a professional.

583
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:31,522
No. No cops.

584
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:35,068
That's final.
This is my deal here, Wade.

585
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:36,152
Yeah.

586
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:38,237
Jean is my wife here.

587
00:40:38,322 --> 00:40:41,157
I gotta tell you, Wade,
I'm leaning to Jerry's viewpoint here.

588
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:42,241
Well...

589
00:40:42,326 --> 00:40:44,494
We got to protect Jean.
These...

590
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:46,371
We're not holding any cards here, Wade.

591
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:48,414
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

592
00:40:48,499 --> 00:40:49,582
You're darn tooting.

593
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:50,750
Oh, damn it.

594
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:52,043
I'm telling you.

595
00:40:52,127 --> 00:40:54,504
Well, why don't we...

596
00:40:55,297 --> 00:40:58,132
Stan, I'm thinking we should offer them
a half a million.

597
00:40:58,217 --> 00:40:59,634
Now, come on here!

598
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:01,719
No way, Wade.
No way.

599
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:03,137
We're not horse-trading here, Wade.

600
00:41:03,222 --> 00:41:04,263
Yeah.

601
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:06,015
We gotta just bite the bullet
on this thing.

602
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,225
Yeah.

603
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:11,938
So, well, what's the
next step here, Jerry?

604
00:41:12,022 --> 00:41:14,607
They're gonna call me up
and give me instructions for a drop.

605
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:16,275
I'm supposed to have the money
ready tomorrow.

606
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,527
Damn it!

607
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,823
How was everything today?

608
00:41:21,907 --> 00:41:23,700
Yeah. Real good, now.

609
00:41:25,536 --> 00:41:27,036
How you doing?

610
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:30,999
Okay.
Now, we'll get the money together.

611
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:33,167
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

612
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:37,171
Now, do you want anyone at home with you
till they call?

613
00:41:37,256 --> 00:41:38,756
No, I...
They don't...

614
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,633
They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

615
00:41:40,718 --> 00:41:41,884
- They were real clear.
- Yeah.

616
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,137
You know, they said no one listening in.

617
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:45,430
They'll be watching.

618
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:47,473
You know, maybe it's all bull,

619
00:41:47,558 --> 00:41:50,101
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

620
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:51,352
Okay.

621
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:54,397
Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

622
00:41:56,275 --> 00:41:58,192
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

623
00:41:58,736 --> 00:42:00,528
Yeah. I'll go talk to him.

624
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:18,379
How you doing there, Scotty?

625
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:20,006
Dad...

626
00:42:20,924 --> 00:42:22,759
What are they doing?

627
00:42:23,594 --> 00:42:25,219
What do you think
they're doing with Mom?

628
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:26,971
It's okay, Scotty.

629
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:28,806
They're not gonna wanna hurt her any.

630
00:42:28,891 --> 00:42:31,517
These men, they just want money.

631
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:34,353
Yeah, well,
what if something goes wrong, Dad?

632
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:38,024
No, no.
Nothing's going wrong here.

633
00:42:38,108 --> 00:42:42,320
Granddad and I, we're, we're making sure
this gets handled right.

634
00:42:43,238 --> 00:42:45,406
I really think
we should call the cops here.

635
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:48,785
No. No. No one can know
about this thing.

636
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:51,120
We gotta play ball with these guys.

637
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:53,331
You ask Stan Grossman,
he'll tell you the same thing.

638
00:42:53,415 --> 00:42:54,415
Yeah. But, Dad...

639
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:57,960
We're gonna get Mom back for you,
but we gotta play ball.

640
00:42:58,212 --> 00:42:59,462
You know?

641
00:43:01,006 --> 00:43:02,882
That's the deal here.

642
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:09,806
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

643
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,434
you just say Mom's down in Florida,
with Pearl and Marty.

644
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:19,774
That's the best we can do here.

645
00:44:03,485 --> 00:44:04,819
No!

646
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,962
No!

647
00:44:28,385 --> 00:44:30,136
Oh, God.

648
00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:47,278
Lunchtime.

649
00:44:47,362 --> 00:44:48,529
Thanks, Margaret.

650
00:44:48,614 --> 00:44:50,364
Hi. Hey.

651
00:44:50,908 --> 00:44:52,450
Willy. Carol.

652
00:44:53,202 --> 00:44:55,161
Janie, two more of those
Skin So Soft, please.

653
00:44:55,245 --> 00:44:56,245
Sure thing.

654
00:44:57,748 --> 00:44:59,165
Hiya, hon.

655
00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:01,042
I brought you some lunch, Margie.

656
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:03,336
What are those?
Night crawlers?

657
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,503
Yeah.

658
00:45:04,588 --> 00:45:05,838
Oh, thanks, hon.

659
00:45:05,923 --> 00:45:08,007
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.

660
00:45:08,091 --> 00:45:10,218
Yeah.
Looks pretty good.

661
00:45:10,302 --> 00:45:13,179
What do we got here, Arby's?

662
00:45:13,263 --> 00:45:14,764
How's the painting going?

663
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:16,307
Pretty good.

664
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:19,769
Found out the Hautmans are entering
a painting this year.

665
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:21,979
Hon, you're better than them.

666
00:45:22,064 --> 00:45:23,940
They're real good.

667
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:27,109
They're good, Norm,
but you're better than them.

668
00:45:28,111 --> 00:45:29,528
You think so?

669
00:45:31,156 --> 00:45:33,449
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

670
00:45:35,827 --> 00:45:37,912
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

671
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:39,538
Not too bad, you know.

672
00:45:39,623 --> 00:45:40,915
How we doing on that vehicle?

673
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:43,668
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

674
00:45:43,752 --> 00:45:47,171
but the night before,
two men checked into the Blue Ox,

675
00:45:47,256 --> 00:45:50,383
registering a Cierra
and leaving the tag space blank.

676
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:51,592
Jeez, that's a good lead.

677
00:45:51,677 --> 00:45:52,760
Yeah.

678
00:45:52,844 --> 00:45:55,346
Blue Ox, that's that truckers' joint
out there on I-35?

679
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,057
Yeah. Owner was on the desk then.

680
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:00,059
Said these two had company.

681
00:46:00,143 --> 00:46:01,227
Oh, yeah?

682
00:46:01,353 --> 00:46:02,478
Yeah.

683
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,693
<i>Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.</i>

684
00:46:08,777 --> 00:46:10,653
I went to Normandale for about
a year and a half.

685
00:46:10,737 --> 00:46:11,862
Yeah, that's where we met.

686
00:46:11,947 --> 00:46:13,030
But I dropped out, though.

687
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:14,156
Yeah, she dropped.

688
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:15,283
Yeah.

689
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:17,076
So where you girls from?

690
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,995
- Chaska.
- Le Sueur.

691
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:21,247
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

692
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:22,581
Go Bears.

693
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:27,086
Okay. I want you to tell me
what these fellows looked like.

694
00:46:27,337 --> 00:46:29,255
Well, the little guy,
he was kind of funny-looking.

695
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:30,339
In what way?

696
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,341
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

697
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:34,760
Can you be any more specific?

698
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:36,220
I couldn't really say.

699
00:46:36,305 --> 00:46:37,722
He wasn't circumcised.

700
00:46:39,182 --> 00:46:41,642
Was he funny-looking apart from that?

701
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:42,852
Yeah.

702
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:47,690
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

703
00:46:48,025 --> 00:46:49,233
Uh-huh.

704
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:51,319
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

705
00:46:51,403 --> 00:46:54,280
No. Like I say,
he was funny-looking.

706
00:46:54,364 --> 00:46:56,407
More than most people, even.

707
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:57,658
What about the other fella?

708
00:46:57,743 --> 00:46:58,909
He was a little older.

709
00:46:58,994 --> 00:47:00,745
You know, he looked like
the Marlboro Man.

710
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:02,455
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

711
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:03,998
But maybe I'm saying that, you know,

712
00:47:04,082 --> 00:47:06,417
'cause he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

713
00:47:06,501 --> 00:47:08,294
You know, like a subconscious
type of thing.

714
00:47:08,378 --> 00:47:09,545
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

715
00:47:09,629 --> 00:47:10,671
Yeah.

716
00:47:10,756 --> 00:47:12,798
Hey, they said they were going
to the Twin Cities.

717
00:47:12,883 --> 00:47:14,342
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

718
00:47:14,426 --> 00:47:15,926
Yeah, is that useful to you?

719
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:17,553
You betcha. Yeah.

720
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:18,971
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

721
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:22,308
<i>Come on!</i>

722
00:47:23,518 --> 00:47:24,769
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

723
00:47:27,064 --> 00:47:28,731
Jesus Christ.

724
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:32,234
Fucking shitbox.

725
00:47:33,653 --> 00:47:35,404
Been here for days.

726
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,616
Damn it.
Nothing to do.

727
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,952
Fucking TV doesn't even...

728
00:47:43,914 --> 00:47:47,666
Damn it, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

729
00:47:49,461 --> 00:47:51,170
Goddamn it!

730
00:47:53,673 --> 00:47:55,633
Unbelievable! Come on!

731
00:47:56,176 --> 00:47:57,176
God...

732
00:47:58,011 --> 00:47:59,178
Fuck!

733
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:02,556
Come on, plug me into the ozone, baby!
Come on!

734
00:48:04,101 --> 00:48:05,393
Come on!

735
00:48:07,187 --> 00:48:08,938
Fuck! Fuck!

736
00:48:10,065 --> 00:48:11,524
Fuck! Fuck!

737
00:48:18,156 --> 00:48:21,700
<i>The bark beetle carries the worm
to its nest</i>

738
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:26,080
<i>where it will feed its young
for up to six months.</i>

739
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:32,044
<i>In the spring, the larvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.</i>

740
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:33,379
Well...

741
00:48:34,673 --> 00:48:36,549
I'm turning in, Norm.

742
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,384
Oh, yeah?

743
00:48:41,304 --> 00:48:43,639
<i>Here it is,
throwing off the larval envelope.</i>

744
00:48:57,696 --> 00:48:58,737
Hello?

745
00:48:58,822 --> 00:49:00,823
<i>Yeah. Is this Marge?</i>

746
00:49:01,116 --> 00:49:02,158
Yeah.

747
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:03,868
<i>Margie Olmstead?</i>

748
00:49:04,953 --> 00:49:07,079
Yeah. Who's this?

749
00:49:07,164 --> 00:49:09,415
<i>This is Mike Yanagita!</i>

750
00:49:09,499 --> 00:49:12,084
<i>You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?</i>

751
00:49:14,504 --> 00:49:16,005
Mike Yanagita?

752
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:17,506
<i>Yeah!</i>

753
00:49:18,091 --> 00:49:20,217
Well, yeah!

754
00:49:20,886 --> 00:49:22,511
Course I remember you.

755
00:49:22,596 --> 00:49:25,055
How are you doing?
What time is it?

756
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,558
<i>Oh, jeez. It's 10:45.</i>

757
00:49:27,642 --> 00:49:29,018
<i>I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

758
00:49:29,102 --> 00:49:31,854
No. That's okay.

759
00:49:31,938 --> 00:49:34,023
<i>Yeah, I'm down in the Twin Cities,</i>

760
00:49:34,107 --> 00:49:36,984
<i>and I was just watching on TV
about these shootings up in Brainerd.</i>

761
00:49:37,068 --> 00:49:38,569
<i>And I saw you on the news there.</i>

762
00:49:38,653 --> 00:49:39,695
Yeah.

763
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:41,335
<i>I thought,
"Jeez, is that Margie Olmstead?"</i>

764
00:49:41,406 --> 00:49:42,573
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

765
00:49:42,657 --> 00:49:44,950
Yeah, that's me.

766
00:49:45,702 --> 00:49:47,369
<i>Well, how the heck are you?</i>

767
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:49,079
Okay. You know.

768
00:49:49,956 --> 00:49:50,956
Okay.

769
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:52,541
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

770
00:49:53,168 --> 00:49:54,627
How you doing?

771
00:49:54,711 --> 00:49:56,337
<i>Pretty good.</i>

772
00:49:57,339 --> 00:49:58,964
Well, heck.

773
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:01,383
It's been such a long time, Mike.

774
00:50:02,177 --> 00:50:04,261
It's great to hear from you.

775
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,475
Yeah, you got your...

776
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:12,645
This is loaded here.
This has your independent...

777
00:50:12,729 --> 00:50:16,065
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

778
00:50:16,149 --> 00:50:19,068
antilock brakes, alarm, radar,

779
00:50:19,569 --> 00:50:22,154
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

780
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:24,490
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

781
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:26,408
Yeah, I don't need no sealant, though.

782
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:28,327
Yeah. You don't need that.

783
00:50:28,411 --> 00:50:30,162
Now, were you thinking
of financing here?

784
00:50:30,247 --> 00:50:32,873
You ought to be aware
of this GMAC plan they have now.

785
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:33,999
It's really super.

786
00:50:34,084 --> 00:50:35,251
Got a call for you, Jerry.

787
00:50:35,335 --> 00:50:36,710
Yeah, okay.

788
00:50:43,635 --> 00:50:44,802
Jerry Lundegaard.

789
00:50:44,886 --> 00:50:47,012
<i>All right, Jerry,
you got the phone to yourself?</i>

790
00:50:47,097 --> 00:50:48,180
Well, yeah.

791
00:50:48,265 --> 00:50:49,306
<i>You know who this is?</i>

792
00:50:49,391 --> 00:50:51,350
Well, yeah, I got an idea.

793
00:50:51,434 --> 00:50:53,310
How's that Cierra working out for you?

794
00:50:53,395 --> 00:50:55,646
<i>Circumstances have changed, Jerry.</i>

795
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:56,855
Well...

796
00:50:57,732 --> 00:50:58,732
What do you mean?

797
00:50:58,817 --> 00:51:02,528
<i>Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry,
beyond the acts of God.</i>

798
00:51:02,612 --> 00:51:03,696
<i>Force majeure.</i>

799
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,030
What the...

800
00:51:05,115 --> 00:51:06,448
How's Jean?

801
00:51:07,909 --> 00:51:08,909
<i>Who's Jean?</i>

802
00:51:08,994 --> 00:51:10,953
My wife. What the...

803
00:51:11,037 --> 00:51:13,080
<i>She's all right, but there's
three people up in Brainerd</i>

804
00:51:13,164 --> 00:51:14,373
<i>who aren't so okay,
I'll tell you that.</i>

805
00:51:14,457 --> 00:51:15,624
What the heck are you talking about?

806
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:17,334
Let's just finish this deal up here.

807
00:51:17,419 --> 00:51:19,587
<i>Blood has been shed, Jerry.</i>

808
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:21,380
What the heck do you mean?

809
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:23,340
<i>Three people in Brainerd.</i>

810
00:51:23,425 --> 00:51:24,466
Oh, jeez.

811
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:26,594
<i>That's right,
and we need more money.</i>

812
00:51:26,678 --> 00:51:27,886
What the heck are you talking about?

813
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:29,888
What do you fellas got yourself
mixed up in?

814
00:51:29,973 --> 00:51:31,015
<i>We need more money...</i>

815
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:33,142
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

816
00:51:33,226 --> 00:51:35,811
<i>Don't ever interrupt me, Jerry!
Just shut the fuck up!</i>

817
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:38,063
Well, I'm sorry, but I just, I...

818
00:51:38,148 --> 00:51:40,274
<i>I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate!</i>

819
00:51:40,358 --> 00:51:41,900
<i>We now want the entire 80,000.</i>

820
00:51:41,985 --> 00:51:43,861
Oh, for Christ's sake here.

821
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:45,154
<i>Blood has been shed.</i>

822
00:51:45,238 --> 00:51:46,488
<i>We've incurred risk, Jerry.</i>

823
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:47,740
<i>I'm coming into town tomorrow.</i>

824
00:51:47,824 --> 00:51:48,907
<i>You have the money ready.</i>

825
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:51,410
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

826
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:52,536
<i>Is it, Jerry?</i>

827
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:54,788
<i>You ask those three poor souls
up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal.</i>

828
00:51:54,873 --> 00:51:55,998
<i>Go ahead, ask them!</i>

829
00:51:56,082 --> 00:51:57,124
The heck do you mean?

830
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,627
<i>"The heck do you mean?"
I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

831
00:52:03,882 --> 00:52:04,882
Yeah?

832
00:52:04,966 --> 00:52:06,008
<i>Jerome Lundegaard?</i>

833
00:52:06,092 --> 00:52:07,134
Yeah.

834
00:52:07,218 --> 00:52:08,886
<i>This is Reilly Diefenbach at GMAC.</i>

835
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:11,722
<i>Sir, I've not received
those vehicle IDs you promised.</i>

836
00:52:11,806 --> 00:52:13,140
Yeah. I...

837
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:14,808
Those are in the mail.

838
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:17,645
<i>That very well may be.
I must inform you, however,</i>

839
00:52:17,729 --> 00:52:20,522
<i>that absent the receipt
of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon,</i>

840
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:23,108
<i>I will have to refer this matter
to our legal department.</i>

841
00:52:23,193 --> 00:52:24,234
Yeah.

842
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,070
<i>- My patience is at an end.
- Yeah.</i>

843
00:52:26,154 --> 00:52:27,655
<i>- Good day, sir.
- Yeah.</i>

844
00:53:26,506 --> 00:53:28,966
Hi, Norm.
How you doing, Margie?

845
00:53:29,718 --> 00:53:31,051
How's the fricassee?

846
00:53:31,136 --> 00:53:32,594
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

847
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:33,929
Oh, no. I got...

848
00:53:34,013 --> 00:53:37,975
Hey, Norm, I thought you was going
ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

849
00:53:38,643 --> 00:53:40,352
Yeah. After lunch.

850
00:53:40,812 --> 00:53:42,146
What you got there?

851
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,648
The numbers you asked for.

852
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:47,401
Calls made from the lobby pay phone
at the Blue Ox.

853
00:53:47,485 --> 00:53:49,528
Two to Minneapolis that night.

854
00:53:49,612 --> 00:53:50,946
First one's a trucking company

855
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,906
and second one's a private residence,

856
00:53:52,991 --> 00:53:54,658
a Shep Proudfoot.

857
00:53:55,785 --> 00:53:57,035
A what?

858
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,371
Shep Proudfoot.
That's a name.

859
00:54:00,123 --> 00:54:01,331
Yeah.

860
00:54:02,459 --> 00:54:04,084
Okay. Yeah.

861
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,045
Think I'll take a drive
down there, then.

862
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:09,047
Oh, yeah?
Twin Cities.

863
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:13,093
Oh, yeah?

864
00:54:27,275 --> 00:54:30,152
Damn it, I want to be a part
of this thing.

865
00:54:30,236 --> 00:54:32,446
No. Wade, they were real clear.

866
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,406
They said they'd call tomorrow
with instructions,

867
00:54:34,491 --> 00:54:36,366
and it's gotta be delivered
by me alone.

868
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:38,702
It's my money, I'll deliver it.

869
00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:40,496
What do they care?

870
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,872
Wade's got a point, there.

871
00:54:41,956 --> 00:54:43,438
I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.

872
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,750
No, no. See, they...

873
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:47,085
No. See, they only deal with me.

874
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:50,923
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

875
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:53,717
They're very...
These guys are dangerous.

876
00:54:53,802 --> 00:54:56,303
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

877
00:54:56,387 --> 00:54:59,264
With all due respect, Jerry,
I don't want you mucking this up.

878
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:00,349
What the heck do you mean?

879
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:01,975
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

880
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,560
Otherwise, I'm going to a professional.

881
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:05,270
No, see...
There's $1 million here.

882
00:55:05,355 --> 00:55:06,438
No. See...

883
00:55:06,523 --> 00:55:09,316
Look, Jerry,
you're not selling me a damn car!

884
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,735
It's my show here.
That's that!

885
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:16,406
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

886
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:24,498
Hi. How you doing?

887
00:55:24,582 --> 00:55:26,291
Real good.
How are you doing today, ma'am?

888
00:55:26,376 --> 00:55:28,627
I'm doing really super there.
Thanks.

889
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:31,547
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

890
00:55:32,715 --> 00:55:35,050
Yep.
You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

891
00:55:35,718 --> 00:55:38,053
Is there a phone down here, you think?

892
00:55:40,223 --> 00:55:41,890
Detective Sibert?

893
00:55:41,975 --> 00:55:45,519
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

894
00:55:46,271 --> 00:55:48,814
Yeah. Well, actually,
I'm in town here.

895
00:55:48,898 --> 00:55:50,858
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

896
00:55:50,942 --> 00:55:52,526
so I thought I'd check in with you

897
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,112
about that USFI search
on Shep Proudfoot.

898
00:55:56,865 --> 00:55:58,156
Oh, yeah?

899
00:55:59,033 --> 00:56:02,202
Well, maybe I'll go visit with him
if I have...

900
00:56:02,287 --> 00:56:04,162
No. I can find that.

901
00:56:05,206 --> 00:56:06,331
Yeah. Well, thanks a bunch.

902
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:09,209
Say, say, would you happen to know

903
00:56:09,294 --> 00:56:12,212
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

904
00:56:13,047 --> 00:56:14,506
The Radisson.

905
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,593
Oh, yeah?
Is it reasonable?

906
00:57:34,712 --> 00:57:36,797
Hi. How you doing?

907
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:39,341
Yeah. I decided not to park here.

908
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:42,010
Well, what do you mean?
You decided not to park here?

909
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:44,930
Yeah, I just came in and I decided
not to park here, so...

910
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:47,683
But...
Well, I'm sorry, sir...

911
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:50,060
Yeah, I decided not to... I...

912
00:57:50,979 --> 00:57:52,145
You know, I'm not...

913
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:54,564
I decided not to take the trip,
as it turns out, so...

914
00:57:54,649 --> 00:57:57,859
Well, I'm sorry, sir,
we still got to charge you the $4.

915
00:57:59,696 --> 00:58:00,988
I just pulled in here.

916
00:58:01,114 --> 00:58:02,447
I just fucking pulled in here.

917
00:58:02,532 --> 00:58:03,615
Well, but...

918
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,159
See, there's a minimum charge of $4.

919
00:58:06,244 --> 00:58:09,037
Long-term parking charges by the day.

920
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:16,878
I guess you think you're, you know,
like an authority figure.

921
00:58:16,963 --> 00:58:19,297
That stupid fucking uniform,
huh, buddy?

922
00:58:19,382 --> 00:58:20,799
King clip-on tie there.

923
00:58:20,883 --> 00:58:22,300
Big fucking man, huh?

924
00:58:22,927 --> 00:58:25,178
You know, these are the limits
of your life, man.

925
00:58:25,263 --> 00:58:26,638
Ruler of your little fucking gate here.

926
00:58:26,723 --> 00:58:29,349
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

927
00:58:31,936 --> 00:58:33,437
Where's Shep?

928
00:58:33,688 --> 00:58:35,355
Talking to a cop.

929
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,606
Cop?

930
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:38,692
Said she was a cop.

931
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,156
So do you remember getting a call
Wednesday night?

932
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,365
Nope.

933
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:49,244
You do reside there
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

934
00:58:49,328 --> 00:58:50,328
Yep.

935
00:58:50,413 --> 00:58:52,414
Anyone else residing there?

936
00:58:52,498 --> 00:58:53,582
No.

937
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:57,669
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past 3:00 in the morning.

938
00:58:57,754 --> 00:59:01,882
It's just hard for me to believe
you don't remember anyone calling.

939
00:59:02,383 --> 00:59:04,676
Now, I know you've had some problems.

940
00:59:04,761 --> 00:59:06,595
Struggling with the narcotics,

941
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:09,598
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

942
00:59:10,308 --> 00:59:11,308
So?

943
00:59:11,392 --> 00:59:12,809
Well, associating with criminals,

944
00:59:12,894 --> 00:59:14,144
if you're the one they talked to,

945
00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:17,355
that right there would be a violation
of your parole.

946
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,941
Would end you up back in Stillwater.

947
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:22,360
Now, I saw some rough stuff
on your priors,

948
00:59:22,445 --> 00:59:24,029
but nothing in the nature of a homicide.

949
00:59:24,113 --> 00:59:28,116
I know you don't want to be an accessory
to something like that.

950
00:59:30,078 --> 00:59:31,203
So, you think you might remember

951
00:59:31,287 --> 00:59:33,789
who those folks were who called you?

952
00:59:42,673 --> 00:59:43,924
Mr. Lundegaard?

953
00:59:44,008 --> 00:59:45,217
Yeah.

954
00:59:45,301 --> 00:59:47,177
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

955
00:59:47,261 --> 00:59:49,054
What is it all about?

956
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:50,806
Do you mind if I sit down?

957
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:52,933
Carrying quite a load here.

958
00:59:53,142 --> 00:59:55,018
You're the owner here,
Mr. Lundegaard?

959
00:59:55,103 --> 00:59:57,437
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

960
00:59:57,522 --> 00:59:59,356
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

961
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,566
My father-in-law, he's the owner.

962
01:00:01,651 --> 01:00:02,818
Uh-huh.

963
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:04,903
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

964
01:00:04,987 --> 01:00:06,738
investigating some malfeasance.

965
01:00:06,823 --> 01:00:09,282
And I was just wondering
if you'd had any new vehicles

966
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:12,452
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

967
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:15,997
Specifically a tan Cutlass Cierra.

968
01:00:20,586 --> 01:00:22,129
Mr. Lundegaard.

969
01:00:24,715 --> 01:00:26,007
Brainerd.

970
01:00:26,759 --> 01:00:28,093
Yeah, yeah.

971
01:00:28,177 --> 01:00:30,679
Home of Paul Bunyan, Babe, the Blue Ox.

972
01:00:30,763 --> 01:00:32,430
Babe, the Blue Ox.

973
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:39,646
Yeah, you know,
we got that big statue up there.

974
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:45,777
So, you haven't had any vehicles
go missing, then?

975
01:00:45,862 --> 01:00:47,362
Nope. No, ma'am.

976
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:49,573
Okey-dokey.
Thanks a bunch.

977
01:00:49,657 --> 01:00:52,659
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork, then.

978
01:01:06,841 --> 01:01:08,383
<i>- Service.
- Yeah, get me Shep.</i>

979
01:01:08,467 --> 01:01:09,718
<i>He's not here right now.</i>

980
01:01:09,802 --> 01:01:10,844
What the heck do you mean?

981
01:01:10,928 --> 01:01:12,470
<i>He stepped out.</i>

982
01:01:12,555 --> 01:01:14,014
<i>- Where'd he go? It's only...
- I'll get you Artie.</i>

983
01:01:14,098 --> 01:01:17,267
No. I don't need a mechanic.
I need a...

984
01:01:19,812 --> 01:01:23,356
Jeez. I gotta talk to a friend of his,

985
01:01:23,816 --> 01:01:25,400
so...

986
01:01:26,027 --> 01:01:28,069
Have him...

987
01:01:29,405 --> 01:01:30,488
<i>What?</i>

988
01:01:30,573 --> 01:01:31,573
Oh, jeez.

989
01:01:52,428 --> 01:01:53,553
Mike?

990
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:55,555
Marge?

991
01:01:57,475 --> 01:02:00,185
Jeez! Oh, you look great!

992
01:02:00,269 --> 01:02:02,520
Yeah. So do you.
Easy there. Easy...

993
01:02:02,605 --> 01:02:05,941
Easy there. Easy there.
You do, too.

994
01:02:06,025 --> 01:02:07,651
I'm expecting now.

995
01:02:07,735 --> 01:02:09,945
I see that. That's great.

996
01:02:10,029 --> 01:02:11,404
What can I get you?

997
01:02:11,489 --> 01:02:13,365
Just a Diet Coke, please.

998
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:15,033
Great.

999
01:02:15,785 --> 01:02:17,077
This is a nice place.

1000
01:02:17,161 --> 01:02:20,622
Yeah. You know, it's the Radisson,
so it's pretty good.

1001
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:21,831
Yeah.

1002
01:02:26,295 --> 01:02:27,379
So...

1003
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,547
You're living in Edina, then?

1004
01:02:29,632 --> 01:02:31,716
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

1005
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:33,551
It's actually Eden Prairie.

1006
01:02:33,636 --> 01:02:35,178
That school district.

1007
01:02:35,596 --> 01:02:38,265
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

1008
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:41,226
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

1009
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,978
Oh, yeah. Long time ago.

1010
01:02:43,062 --> 01:02:44,688
Great, great.

1011
01:02:45,022 --> 01:02:47,482
So, what brings you down?

1012
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:49,693
Are you down here on that homicide,

1013
01:02:49,777 --> 01:02:52,028
if you're allowed, you know,
to discuss that?

1014
01:02:52,113 --> 01:02:53,405
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1015
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:56,283
But there's not a heck
of a lot to discuss.

1016
01:02:57,159 --> 01:02:58,702
Okay.

1017
01:02:58,786 --> 01:03:00,078
Well, what about you, Mike?

1018
01:03:00,162 --> 01:03:01,413
Are you married?

1019
01:03:01,497 --> 01:03:02,580
You got kids?

1020
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:04,457
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1021
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:07,711
I was married.
I was married to...

1022
01:03:07,795 --> 01:03:09,713
You mind if I sit over here?

1023
01:03:09,797 --> 01:03:11,798
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1024
01:03:11,882 --> 01:03:14,968
No. Why don't you sit over there?
I prefer that.

1025
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,306
Okay.

1026
01:03:22,184 --> 01:03:23,268
Sorry.

1027
01:03:23,352 --> 01:03:26,104
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

1028
01:03:26,188 --> 01:03:28,440
Sure, sure. I understand.

1029
01:03:29,692 --> 01:03:30,942
I didn't mean to...

1030
01:03:31,027 --> 01:03:34,487
No, no. That's fine.

1031
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:39,034
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

1032
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:42,454
So, I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1033
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:45,332
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

1034
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:46,875
Yeah. I think I remember her.

1035
01:03:46,959 --> 01:03:49,753
Yeah! She...
Oh, yeah!

1036
01:03:49,837 --> 01:03:51,421
So, it didn't work out, huh?

1037
01:03:51,505 --> 01:03:55,050
And then I've been working for Honeywell
for a few years now.

1038
01:03:55,134 --> 01:03:56,301
Well, they're a good outfit.

1039
01:03:56,385 --> 01:04:00,138
Yeah, if you're an engineer, yeah,
you could do a lot worse.

1040
01:04:00,222 --> 01:04:01,890
But it's not...

1041
01:04:01,974 --> 01:04:04,142
It's nothing like your achievement.

1042
01:04:04,226 --> 01:04:07,228
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

1043
01:04:07,313 --> 01:04:08,897
It's not that...

1044
01:04:08,981 --> 01:04:12,233
It's not that things didn't work out.
It's...

1045
01:04:13,652 --> 01:04:16,446
Linda had leukemia, you know.

1046
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:19,366
She was...
She passed away.

1047
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:20,867
No.

1048
01:04:23,287 --> 01:04:24,412
It was tough.

1049
01:04:24,497 --> 01:04:25,789
There you go.

1050
01:04:26,248 --> 01:04:27,916
It was long...

1051
01:04:29,293 --> 01:04:31,920
She fought real hard, Marge.

1052
01:04:32,797 --> 01:04:34,172
You know...

1053
01:04:34,924 --> 01:04:36,508
So, what can you say?

1054
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:41,763
Better times, huh?

1055
01:04:41,847 --> 01:04:43,306
Better times.

1056
01:04:45,893 --> 01:04:50,730
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

1057
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,607
I always liked you.

1058
01:04:52,691 --> 01:04:53,942
Well, I always liked you...

1059
01:04:54,026 --> 01:04:55,777
I always liked you so much.

1060
01:04:59,949 --> 01:05:02,742
So, Mike, should we get together
another time, you think?

1061
01:05:02,827 --> 01:05:04,160
No! I...

1062
01:05:08,499 --> 01:05:10,166
I'm sorry. It's...

1063
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:12,627
You know,
I shouldn't have done this.

1064
01:05:12,711 --> 01:05:14,754
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

1065
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:17,382
I thought we'd have
a really terrific time.

1066
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:18,883
It's okay, Mike.

1067
01:05:18,968 --> 01:05:21,469
You were such a super lady.

1068
01:05:21,554 --> 01:05:24,806
And then...
I've been so lonely.

1069
01:05:27,685 --> 01:05:29,185
It's okay, Mike.

1070
01:05:35,526 --> 01:05:39,362
<i>Here's a song I dedicate
to all the ladies out here tonight.</i>

1071
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:41,656
Goes like this.

1072
01:05:42,533 --> 01:05:45,577
<i>♪ Let's find each other tonight ♪</i>

1073
01:05:46,412 --> 01:05:48,830
<i>♪ Everything will be all right ♪</i>

1074
01:05:50,249 --> 01:05:52,167
<i>♪ Don't hesitate now ♪</i>

1075
01:05:52,251 --> 01:05:53,918
<i>♪ Let's find each other tonight ♪</i>

1076
01:05:54,044 --> 01:05:55,336
So...

1077
01:05:56,005 --> 01:05:57,964
Are you from around here?

1078
01:05:58,757 --> 01:06:00,592
Just in town on business.

1079
01:06:01,177 --> 01:06:02,260
Just in and out.

1080
01:06:05,014 --> 01:06:07,557
Just a little of the old in-and-out.

1081
01:06:08,684 --> 01:06:10,101
What do you do?

1082
01:06:11,353 --> 01:06:12,437
I...

1083
01:06:16,442 --> 01:06:17,942
You been to the Celebrity Room before?

1084
01:06:18,027 --> 01:06:19,986
With other clients?

1085
01:06:20,488 --> 01:06:21,946
I don't think so.

1086
01:06:22,031 --> 01:06:23,490
It's nice.

1087
01:06:23,574 --> 01:06:26,034
Yeah, well, depends on the artist.

1088
01:06:26,202 --> 01:06:29,329
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

1089
01:06:29,955 --> 01:06:31,039
Waiter!

1090
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:34,876
What is he, deaf?

1091
01:06:35,711 --> 01:06:36,961
So...

1092
01:06:38,047 --> 01:06:40,423
How long you work
for the escort service?

1093
01:06:40,508 --> 01:06:42,592
I don't know. A few months.

1094
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:46,179
Find that work interesting, do you?

1095
01:06:47,264 --> 01:06:49,307
What are you talking about?

1096
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:51,142
Right.

1097
01:06:51,227 --> 01:06:52,560
Come on.

1098
01:06:52,645 --> 01:06:54,646
I'm hearing bells.
Come on.

1099
01:06:56,482 --> 01:06:59,025
All right. Where were you?

1100
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:06,658
Shep, what the hell are you doing?
I'm banging that girl.

1101
01:07:06,742 --> 01:07:11,120
Fucking asshole.
Get the fuck out of here.

1102
01:07:11,247 --> 01:07:14,207
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

1103
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:15,833
Get the fuck out of here.

1104
01:07:17,044 --> 01:07:18,920
Yo! Cut that shit out, man.

1105
01:07:19,004 --> 01:07:20,964
Trying to get some goddamn sleep here.

1106
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:23,132
Come on, brother...

1107
01:07:23,217 --> 01:07:24,467
Fuck you!

1108
01:07:30,891 --> 01:07:32,308
Fuck you.

1109
01:07:32,393 --> 01:07:33,560
Animals!

1110
01:07:35,563 --> 01:07:37,188
Stay away from me, man.

1111
01:07:37,273 --> 01:07:39,357
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!

1112
01:07:39,441 --> 01:07:41,317
Don't you dare fucking hit me!

1113
01:07:48,742 --> 01:07:50,451
Fucking little weasel!

1114
01:07:50,536 --> 01:07:52,245
- Fuck you, man.
- Stop it!

1115
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:56,165
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

1116
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,877
Jesus Christ!
You fucking shitbag motherfucker!

1117
01:08:03,841 --> 01:08:04,841
<i>Yeah?</i>

1118
01:08:04,925 --> 01:08:06,134
All right, Jerry,
I'm through fucking around.

1119
01:08:06,218 --> 01:08:07,302
<i>You got the fucking money?</i>

1120
01:08:07,386 --> 01:08:09,429
Yeah, I got the money, but...

1121
01:08:09,513 --> 01:08:11,222
<i>Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.</i>

1122
01:08:11,307 --> 01:08:14,267
<i>I want you to put this money in the Dayton
Radisson parking ramp, top level,</i>

1123
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:15,893
<i>30 minutes, Jerry,
we wrap this thing up.</i>

1124
01:08:15,978 --> 01:08:17,020
Okay. But...

1125
01:08:17,104 --> 01:08:19,355
Hey, you're there in 30 minutes
or I find you, Jerry,

1126
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,898
and I shoot you
and I shoot your fucking wife,

1127
01:08:20,983 --> 01:08:22,275
and I shoot all
your little fucking children

1128
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:24,861
and I shoot them all in the back
of their little fucking heads. You got it?

1129
01:08:24,945 --> 01:08:26,738
Okay, now,
you stay away from Scotty, now.

1130
01:08:26,822 --> 01:08:27,864
<i>Got it?</i>

1131
01:08:27,948 --> 01:08:29,574
Okay. Real good, then.

1132
01:08:54,642 --> 01:08:55,850
Dad.

1133
01:08:56,477 --> 01:08:57,852
It's okay, Scotty.

1134
01:08:57,936 --> 01:08:59,604
Where you going?

1135
01:08:59,938 --> 01:09:02,023
I'll be back in a minute.

1136
01:09:02,274 --> 01:09:06,611
If Stan calls,
you just tell him I went to Embers.

1137
01:09:08,947 --> 01:09:10,031
Okay.

1138
01:09:10,741 --> 01:09:12,700
Here's your damn money.

1139
01:09:13,494 --> 01:09:15,495
Now, where's my daughter?

1140
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:17,246
Yeah.

1141
01:09:17,665 --> 01:09:20,541
You goddamn punk!

1142
01:09:36,892 --> 01:09:38,685
Who the fuck are you?

1143
01:09:41,563 --> 01:09:43,314
Who the fuck are you?

1144
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:46,442
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

1145
01:09:47,403 --> 01:09:49,028
I am through fucking around!

1146
01:09:49,113 --> 01:09:50,822
Drop that fucking briefcase!

1147
01:09:50,906 --> 01:09:52,490
Where's my daughter?

1148
01:09:52,574 --> 01:09:54,909
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?

1149
01:09:54,993 --> 01:09:57,328
I gave simple fucking instructions.

1150
01:09:57,413 --> 01:09:59,122
Where's my damn daughter?

1151
01:09:59,206 --> 01:10:00,498
No Jean, no money.

1152
01:10:00,582 --> 01:10:02,500
Drop that fucking money!

1153
01:10:02,584 --> 01:10:04,252
No Jean, no money!

1154
01:10:06,046 --> 01:10:08,047
Is this a fucking joke here?

1155
01:10:14,555 --> 01:10:18,015
Oh, jeez.

1156
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,184
You happy now, asshole?

1157
01:10:20,269 --> 01:10:21,936
What's with you people?

1158
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,896
You fucking imbeciles!

1159
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:33,865
You fucking shot me!

1160
01:11:50,984 --> 01:11:53,069
May I have your ticket, please?

1161
01:11:53,153 --> 01:11:54,862
Open the fucking gate!

1162
01:12:34,403 --> 01:12:35,862
Oh, jeez.

1163
01:13:06,101 --> 01:13:07,184
Dad?

1164
01:13:07,269 --> 01:13:08,352
Yeah?

1165
01:13:08,812 --> 01:13:10,605
Stan Grossman called.

1166
01:13:10,939 --> 01:13:12,231
Yeah. Okay.

1167
01:13:12,316 --> 01:13:13,316
Twice.

1168
01:13:13,442 --> 01:13:14,442
Okay.

1169
01:13:16,445 --> 01:13:18,154
Is everything okay?

1170
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:19,655
Yeah.

1171
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:23,200
Are you calling Stan?

1172
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:26,954
Well, I'm...

1173
01:13:28,498 --> 01:13:30,333
I'm going to bed now.

1174
01:14:07,204 --> 01:14:08,371
How you doing?

1175
01:14:08,455 --> 01:14:10,081
- Mr. Mohra?
- Yeah?

1176
01:14:10,415 --> 01:14:11,582
Officer Olson.

1177
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:13,167
Yeah. Righto.

1178
01:14:14,002 --> 01:14:15,211
Well...

1179
01:14:15,295 --> 01:14:18,464
So I'm tending bar down there at Ecklund
and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1180
01:14:18,548 --> 01:14:20,257
and this little guy's drinking,

1181
01:14:20,342 --> 01:14:22,385
and he says,
"Where can a guy find some action?

1182
01:14:22,469 --> 01:14:24,720
"I'm going crazy out
there at the lake."

1183
01:14:24,805 --> 01:14:26,263
And I says,
"What kind of action?"

1184
01:14:26,348 --> 01:14:28,557
And he says,
"Woman action. What do I look like?"

1185
01:14:28,642 --> 01:14:30,101
And I says,
"Well, what do I look like?

1186
01:14:30,185 --> 01:14:32,311
"I don't arrange that kind of thing."

1187
01:14:32,396 --> 01:14:34,939
And he says,
"But I'm going crazy out there at the lake."

1188
01:14:35,023 --> 01:14:38,275
And I says,
"Yeah, but this ain't that kind of place."

1189
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,821
He says, "Oh, so I get it. So you think
I'm some kind of jerk for asking."

1190
01:14:41,905 --> 01:14:43,447
Only he don't use the word "jerk."

1191
01:14:43,532 --> 01:14:45,116
I understand.
Then he calls me a jerk,

1192
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,618
says the last guy thought he's a jerk
is dead now.

1193
01:14:47,703 --> 01:14:49,286
So, I don't say nothing.

1194
01:14:49,371 --> 01:14:51,288
He says,
"What do you think about that?"

1195
01:14:51,373 --> 01:14:54,792
And I says, "Well, that don't sound
like too good a deal for him, then."

1196
01:14:54,876 --> 01:14:55,918
You got that right.

1197
01:14:56,003 --> 01:14:57,753
Yeah, he says,
"Yeah, that guy's dead,

1198
01:14:57,838 --> 01:14:59,296
"and I don't mean of old age."

1199
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:02,925
And then he says, "Jeez, I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1200
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:04,010
White Bear Lake?

1201
01:15:04,094 --> 01:15:06,554
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1202
01:15:06,638 --> 01:15:07,805
So I made that assumption.

1203
01:15:07,889 --> 01:15:08,889
Sure.

1204
01:15:08,932 --> 01:15:10,725
Anyway, he's drinking at the bar,

1205
01:15:10,809 --> 01:15:12,518
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

1206
01:15:12,602 --> 01:15:15,646
but then Mrs. Mohra,
she heard about the homicides down here

1207
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:19,859
and thought I should call it in,
so I called it in.

1208
01:15:22,112 --> 01:15:23,654
End of story.

1209
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:25,740
Well, what'd this guy look like, anyways?

1210
01:15:25,824 --> 01:15:27,408
Oh, he's a...

1211
01:15:27,534 --> 01:15:29,118
Little guy,
kind of funny-looking.

1212
01:15:30,078 --> 01:15:31,454
In what way?

1213
01:15:31,538 --> 01:15:33,497
Just in a general kind of way.

1214
01:15:33,582 --> 01:15:36,167
Okay. Well, thanks a bunch,
Mr. Mohra.

1215
01:15:36,251 --> 01:15:37,960
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1216
01:15:38,045 --> 01:15:39,211
but thanks for calling her in.

1217
01:15:39,296 --> 01:15:40,546
Sure.

1218
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:43,215
Looks like she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.

1219
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,593
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

1220
01:15:45,761 --> 01:15:47,970
Yeah.
You got that right.

1221
01:16:07,324 --> 01:16:08,741
Jesus Christ.

1222
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:28,839
Valerie, I'm leaving this morning,
back up to Brainerd.

1223
01:18:28,924 --> 01:18:31,342
<i>Well, I'm sorry I won't see you.</i>

1224
01:18:31,593 --> 01:18:32,843
But you think he's all right?

1225
01:18:32,928 --> 01:18:34,053
I saw him last night and...

1226
01:18:34,137 --> 01:18:35,179
<i>What did he say?</i>

1227
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,972
Well, it's nothing specific he said.

1228
01:18:37,057 --> 01:18:40,226
It just seemed like it all hit him
really hard, his wife dying.

1229
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:42,186
<i>- His wife?
- Linda.</i>

1230
01:18:42,312 --> 01:18:44,313
<i>- Who?
- Linda Cooksey.</i>

1231
01:18:44,397 --> 01:18:46,190
<i>No. No, no.
They weren't...</i>

1232
01:18:46,274 --> 01:18:49,193
<i>He was bothering Linda for about...
For a good year.</i>

1233
01:18:49,277 --> 01:18:52,404
<i>Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.</i>

1234
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:53,989
So...

1235
01:18:54,532 --> 01:18:55,991
He didn't...

1236
01:18:56,534 --> 01:18:57,534
He never...

1237
01:18:57,619 --> 01:18:59,328
<i>No! No, they never married.</i>

1238
01:18:59,412 --> 01:19:01,872
<i>Mike's had psychiatric problems.</i>

1239
01:19:01,957 --> 01:19:03,374
Oh, my.

1240
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:04,959
<i>Yeah, he's been struggling.</i>

1241
01:19:05,043 --> 01:19:07,378
<i>He's living with his parents now.</i>

1242
01:19:08,546 --> 01:19:09,880
Oh, jeez.

1243
01:19:09,965 --> 01:19:12,383
<i>Linda's fine.
You should call her.</i>

1244
01:19:12,467 --> 01:19:14,009
Jeez. Well...

1245
01:19:14,636 --> 01:19:15,761
Jeez.

1246
01:19:17,472 --> 01:19:19,139
That's a surprise.

1247
01:19:29,192 --> 01:19:30,359
Hello!

1248
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,320
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

1249
01:20:14,404 --> 01:20:17,448
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

1250
01:20:17,532 --> 01:20:20,034
I understand.
I'll keep it real short, then.

1251
01:20:20,118 --> 01:20:22,953
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1252
01:20:23,038 --> 01:20:24,246
Do you mind if I sit down?

1253
01:20:24,331 --> 01:20:25,456
Carrying a bit of a load here.

1254
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,665
No, I...

1255
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,491
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1256
01:20:28,543 --> 01:20:29,585
I was just wondering...

1257
01:20:29,669 --> 01:20:32,796
Yeah, like I told you,
we haven't had any vehicles go missing.

1258
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:34,923
Okay. Are you sure?

1259
01:20:35,925 --> 01:20:38,344
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

1260
01:20:38,428 --> 01:20:40,095
Because, see,
the crime I'm investigating,

1261
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:42,348
the perpetrators were driving a car
with dealer plates,

1262
01:20:42,432 --> 01:20:43,682
and they called someone who works here,

1263
01:20:43,767 --> 01:20:45,471
so it'd be quite a coincidence
if they weren't,

1264
01:20:45,518 --> 01:20:47,311
you know, connected.

1265
01:20:47,937 --> 01:20:49,355
Yeah, I see.

1266
01:20:49,522 --> 01:20:50,856
So, how do you...

1267
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,067
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1268
01:20:53,151 --> 01:20:54,818
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

1269
01:20:54,903 --> 01:20:56,987
But how do you know that for sure
without doing a...

1270
01:20:57,072 --> 01:20:58,739
Well, I would know.

1271
01:20:58,907 --> 01:21:00,574
I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

1272
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:02,368
Yeah, but I understand...

1273
01:21:02,452 --> 01:21:03,994
We run a pretty tight ship here.

1274
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:05,079
I know, but...

1275
01:21:05,163 --> 01:21:07,206
Well, how do they establish that, sir?

1276
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:08,707
I mean, are the cars counted daily,

1277
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:10,667
or what kind of a routine here?

1278
01:21:10,752 --> 01:21:13,212
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1279
01:21:17,509 --> 01:21:18,550
I'm sorry, sir?

1280
01:21:18,635 --> 01:21:20,928
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1281
01:21:21,596 --> 01:21:22,679
I answered the darn...

1282
01:21:22,764 --> 01:21:26,016
I'm cooperating here,
and there's no...

1283
01:21:29,687 --> 01:21:32,523
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

1284
01:21:32,607 --> 01:21:34,149
I'm just doing my job here.

1285
01:21:34,234 --> 01:21:35,401
I'm...

1286
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:40,322
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

1287
01:21:40,407 --> 01:21:42,783
I'm cooperating, and there's no...

1288
01:21:42,867 --> 01:21:44,952
We're doing all we can.

1289
01:21:51,668 --> 01:21:54,461
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

1290
01:21:58,466 --> 01:21:59,967
Mr. Lundegaard.

1291
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:06,598
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

1292
01:22:06,683 --> 01:22:09,351
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

1293
01:22:09,436 --> 01:22:12,354
Okay!
I'll do a damn lot count!

1294
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:13,522
Sir, right now?

1295
01:22:13,606 --> 01:22:15,190
Yeah! Right now.

1296
01:22:15,859 --> 01:22:17,651
You're darn tooting!

1297
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:21,530
If it's so damned important to you.

1298
01:22:22,157 --> 01:22:23,866
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1299
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:26,160
What the Christ! Jeez!

1300
01:22:39,674 --> 01:22:42,509
<i>Bob Elcorona, line two.</i>

1301
01:23:10,914 --> 01:23:12,706
For Pete's sake.

1302
01:23:16,377 --> 01:23:18,295
For Pete's sake,
he's fleeing the interview.

1303
01:23:18,379 --> 01:23:20,547
He's fleeing the interview!

1304
01:23:21,883 --> 01:23:24,301
How do I get an outside line here?

1305
01:23:26,137 --> 01:23:27,387
All right.

1306
01:23:30,642 --> 01:23:32,935
Yeah. Detective Sibert, please.

1307
01:23:34,729 --> 01:23:37,397
<i>I told you it was over,
and I thought I made myself very clear.</i>

1308
01:23:37,482 --> 01:23:40,275
<i>Oh, you did.
You made yourself perfectly clear.</i>

1309
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,236
<i>But something's come up.</i>

1310
01:23:42,695 --> 01:23:43,779
<i>What?</i>

1311
01:23:44,072 --> 01:23:45,405
<i>Well, it's something kind of small,</i>

1312
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:47,699
<i>but it might be a big problem.</i>

1313
01:23:47,825 --> 01:23:49,326
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

1314
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,412
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

1315
01:23:54,249 --> 01:23:56,833
<i>I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,</i>

1316
01:23:56,918 --> 01:24:00,420
<i>and there's no doubt about it,
I'm gonna have your baby.</i>

1317
01:24:03,091 --> 01:24:05,551
<i>Now, look here.
I can explain this.</i>

1318
01:24:05,718 --> 01:24:09,096
<i>See, Robin was...
Is a student of mine.</i>

1319
01:24:10,014 --> 01:24:12,266
You should see the other guy.

1320
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:14,726
<i>No, no, no.
It wasn't anything like that.</i>

1321
01:24:14,811 --> 01:24:15,936
<i>You don't understand!</i>

1322
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:17,771
<i>I read that letter that she wrote.</i>

1323
01:24:17,855 --> 01:24:19,439
<i>I think I understand all there is...</i>

1324
01:24:19,524 --> 01:24:21,275
What happened to her?

1325
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:25,237
She started shrieking, you know.

1326
01:24:25,321 --> 01:24:26,446
Jeez.

1327
01:24:27,198 --> 01:24:29,283
Well, I got the money.

1328
01:24:29,784 --> 01:24:32,452
All of it, all 80 grand.

1329
01:24:34,622 --> 01:24:37,332
That's 40 for you, 40 for me.

1330
01:24:39,419 --> 01:24:41,003
That's it, then.

1331
01:24:45,758 --> 01:24:47,259
You can have my truck.

1332
01:24:47,385 --> 01:24:48,885
I'm taking the Cierra.

1333
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:50,470
We split that.

1334
01:24:52,599 --> 01:24:55,851
How the fuck do you split
a fucking car, you dummy?

1335
01:24:56,144 --> 01:24:58,145
With a fucking chain saw?

1336
01:24:58,396 --> 01:25:01,064
One of us pays the other for half.

1337
01:25:01,316 --> 01:25:03,817
Hold on.
No fucking way.

1338
01:25:04,694 --> 01:25:06,820
Did you fucking notice this?

1339
01:25:07,655 --> 01:25:09,364
I got fucking shot!

1340
01:25:09,741 --> 01:25:11,992
I got fucking shot in the face!

1341
01:25:12,076 --> 01:25:13,619
I went and got the fucking money!

1342
01:25:13,703 --> 01:25:15,454
I got shot fucking picking it up!

1343
01:25:15,538 --> 01:25:18,248
I've been up for 36 fucking hours!

1344
01:25:19,584 --> 01:25:21,043
I'm taking that fucking car!

1345
01:25:21,127 --> 01:25:24,463
That fuck is mine,
you fucking asshole.

1346
01:25:24,672 --> 01:25:27,966
You know, I've been listening
to your fucking bullshit all week!

1347
01:25:28,092 --> 01:25:29,593
Are we square?

1348
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:33,472
Are we square?

1349
01:25:35,516 --> 01:25:37,392
Yeah, you fucking mute!

1350
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:41,396
And if you see your friend,
Shep Proudfoot,

1351
01:25:41,481 --> 01:25:43,940
tell him I'm gonna nail his fucking ass.

1352
01:25:46,069 --> 01:25:48,320
<i>I'll call you...
Later.</i>

1353
01:25:59,999 --> 01:26:03,210
<i>His wife. This guy says
she was kidnapped last Wednesday.</i>

1354
01:26:03,294 --> 01:26:04,753
The day of our homicides.

1355
01:26:04,837 --> 01:26:05,921
<i>Yeah.</i>

1356
01:26:06,005 --> 01:26:07,297
And this guy was who?

1357
01:26:07,382 --> 01:26:10,008
<i>Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.</i>

1358
01:26:10,093 --> 01:26:11,760
Gustafson's accountant.

1359
01:26:11,844 --> 01:26:12,969
<i>Yeah.</i>

1360
01:26:13,054 --> 01:26:14,721
But we still haven't found Gustafson?

1361
01:26:14,806 --> 01:26:16,515
<i>Looking...</i>

1362
01:26:16,599 --> 01:26:18,308
Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.

1363
01:26:18,393 --> 01:26:19,976
<i>Still missing.
We're looking.</i>

1364
01:26:20,061 --> 01:26:22,062
Copy. And Lundegaard, too?

1365
01:26:22,271 --> 01:26:24,690
<i>Yeah.
Where are you, Margie?</i>

1366
01:26:24,774 --> 01:26:25,941
I'm almost back.

1367
01:26:26,025 --> 01:26:27,567
I'm taking a drive around Moose Lake.

1368
01:26:27,652 --> 01:26:29,653
<i>Gary's loudmouth.</i>

1369
01:26:29,946 --> 01:26:31,321
Yeah, the loudmouth.

1370
01:26:31,406 --> 01:26:32,989
So the whole state has it, huh?

1371
01:26:33,074 --> 01:26:34,908
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

1372
01:26:34,992 --> 01:26:36,284
<i>Yeah. It's over the wire.</i>

1373
01:26:36,369 --> 01:26:37,744
<i>It's everywhere.
They'll find them.</i>

1374
01:26:37,829 --> 01:26:38,954
Copy.

1375
01:26:39,414 --> 01:26:40,539
<i>Yeah, we got a lead on this...</i>

1376
01:26:40,623 --> 01:26:41,998
There's the car!
There's the car!

1377
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:43,083
<i>Whose car?</i>

1378
01:26:43,167 --> 01:26:46,503
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

1379
01:26:47,088 --> 01:26:50,090
<i>Okay. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple cars.</i>

1380
01:28:43,579 --> 01:28:44,788
Police!

1381
01:28:52,547 --> 01:28:54,130
Hands up!

1382
01:28:54,423 --> 01:28:55,632
Police!

1383
01:28:58,928 --> 01:29:00,220
Police!

1384
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,450
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

1385
01:30:08,539 --> 01:30:12,083
And I guess that was your accomplice
in the wood chipper.

1386
01:30:16,756 --> 01:30:19,174
And those three people in Brainerd.

1387
01:30:24,555 --> 01:30:26,014
And for what?

1388
01:30:27,224 --> 01:30:29,267
For a little bit of money.

1389
01:30:34,815 --> 01:30:38,068
There's more to life than a little money,
you know?

1390
01:30:47,703 --> 01:30:49,496
Don't you know that?

1391
01:30:55,878 --> 01:30:57,629
And here you are.

1392
01:30:58,839 --> 01:31:00,799
And it's a beautiful day.

1393
01:31:10,142 --> 01:31:11,351
Well...

1394
01:31:24,198 --> 01:31:26,282
I just don't understand it.

1395
01:32:08,617 --> 01:32:10,076
Mr. Anderson?

1396
01:32:11,412 --> 01:32:12,662
Who?

1397
01:32:12,747 --> 01:32:16,166
Mr. Anderson, is this
your burgundy '98 out here?

1398
01:32:17,585 --> 01:32:19,044
Just a sec.

1399
01:32:19,128 --> 01:32:20,837
Could you open the door, please?

1400
01:32:20,921 --> 01:32:22,839
Yeah, yeah, just a sec.

1401
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:24,716
Just a sec.

1402
01:32:32,266 --> 01:32:34,225
- Dale!
- My leg!

1403
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:35,518
No!

1404
01:33:14,809 --> 01:33:16,476
They announced it.

1405
01:33:18,062 --> 01:33:19,479
They announced it?

1406
01:33:19,563 --> 01:33:20,688
Yeah.

1407
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:22,232
So?

1408
01:33:23,234 --> 01:33:24,859
Three-cent stamp.

1409
01:33:25,611 --> 01:33:27,070
Your mallard?

1410
01:33:27,321 --> 01:33:28,363
Yeah.

1411
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,074
That's terrific.

1412
01:33:31,158 --> 01:33:33,118
It's just a three-cent.

1413
01:33:33,661 --> 01:33:34,744
It's terrific.

1414
01:33:34,829 --> 01:33:37,539
Hautman's blue-winged teal
got the 29-cent.

1415
01:33:38,165 --> 01:33:40,291
People don't much use the three-cent.

1416
01:33:40,376 --> 01:33:42,961
Oh, for Pete's...
Of course they do.

1417
01:33:44,171 --> 01:33:45,630
Whenever they raise the postage,

1418
01:33:45,714 --> 01:33:47,590
people need the little stamps.

1419
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:49,425
Yeah?

1420
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:52,512
When they're stuck
with a bunch of the old ones.

1421
01:33:52,596 --> 01:33:53,847
Yeah.

1422
01:33:54,598 --> 01:33:55,974
I guess.

1423
01:33:57,476 --> 01:34:00,603
That's terrific.
I'm so proud of you, Norm.

1424
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:07,152
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

1425
01:34:09,697 --> 01:34:11,489
I love you, Margie.

1426
01:34:12,533 --> 01:34:14,159
I love you, Norm.

1427
01:34:17,371 --> 01:34:18,997
Two more months.

1428
01:34:22,566 --> 01:34:23,860
Two more months.
