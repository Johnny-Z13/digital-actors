When the player tries to open the door with the command "Luna, Open Door" Luna sends a private message to the player saying "Access Denied"
This message won't appear in the  conversation but the player will have this information after saying "Luna, Open Door".

After using the command "Luna scan", the player sees that the door ID is written as "LM-023".
