Narrator: A woman comes by with a trolley full of sweets, she asks the kids if they want anything off the trolley. Ron talks then
Ron: No, thanks. Just got these sandwiches from my mum. They're a bit squished, but they'll do.
Harry: Oh, I'll take some of everything, please. \smiles and looks at the trolley excitedly\ How about you, Ron? Never tried magical sweets before!
Ron: No worries, mate. I'm all set with these. \holds up the sandwiches\ But tell me, what's your favorite sweet from that lot? Got any recommendations?
Harry: Actually, I haven't tried any of these before. I'm new to all this! \glances curiously at the assorted sweets\ Maybe you can tell me which ones are good?
Ron: Blimey, mate, where to start? Those Chocolate Frogs are brilliant – they even come with collectible cards! I’ve got about 500 of them myself. And watch out for the Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans – you could end up with anything from chocolate to, well, bogey flavour! \laughs\ What about you, then? Ever collect anything fun?
Harry: Oh, collectible cards sound exciting! I used to collect dinosaur cards when I was younger. \grins\ I’ll definitely try the Chocolate Frogs then. Thanks for the tip, Ron! \pauses\ So, you're from a wizarding family? I'm still trying to catch up on everything about this world.
Ron: Yeah, full wizard, me. It’s all a bit normal for us, I s'pose. But don't worry, you'll get the hang of it quick enough! \smiles reassuringly\ So, what's your name?
Harry: I'm Harry, Harry Potter. \extends hand for a handshake\ Nice to meet you, Ron! How long is the train ride to Hogwarts? I'm trying to learn as much as I can before we get there.
Ron: Harry Potter, eh? \eyes widen slightly\ I've heard loads about you! Nice to meet ya, Harry. The train ride to Hogwarts is a fair bit, still got a couple of hours to go, I reckon. Plenty of time to chat about all things wizarding. \pats the seat next to him\ Make yourself comfy here, mate.
Narrator: \A bit later, Harry and Ron are now sitting together eating bundles of sweets. Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over his head.\
Narrator: \Harry sees a sweet called Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans\
Narrator: \There is a blue and gold package between the sweets Harry hadn't noticed until now\
Narrator: \There was a chocolate frog in the packet that jumps onto the window and climbs up.\
Narrator: \The frog reaches the open gap in the window and jumps out.\ 
Narrator: \Harry sees an image of Dumbledore in the card.\
Narrator: \Harry looks at the card again, but Dumbledore has vanished.\
Narrator: \Scabbers squeaks\
Narrator: \A girl with bushy brown hair, dressed in robes, appears at the doorway.\
Hermione: Hello, I'm Hermione Granger. I'm sorry for the interruption, but have either of you seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
Harry: Oh, hello Hermione! No, we haven't seen a toad here, but we can help look for it if you'd like. \smiles and gestures around their compartment\ I’m Harry, by the way, and this is Ron. What can you tell us about Hogwarts? I’m still learning everything.
Hermione: Thank you, Harry, and it's nice to meet you, Ron. I'd appreciate any help in finding that toad; Neville is quite upset about it. Regarding Hogwarts, you're in for an extraordinary experience. The school is divided into four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each has its own noble history and competes for the House Cup. Oh, and be sure to pay close attention in your classes – the magic taught at Hogwarts is very real and very potent! \smiles knowingly\
Harry: That sounds fascinating, Hermione! I wonder which house I'll end up in. \looks thoughtful\ So, what's your favorite subject at Hogwarts? And, um, do you know any good spells already?
Hermione: Oh, I've read quite a bit about each subject, but I'm particularly excited about Charms and Transfiguration. They seem absolutely fascinating. And yes, I've learned a few spells already! For example, I can perform the 'Oculus Reparo' spell, which is used to fix broken glasses. Would you like to see? \smiles eagerly\
Harry: Yes, please, Hermione! That would be amazing to see. \looks intrigued\ Also, how did you manage to learn spells before even starting at Hogwarts? I'd love to get a head start too if I can.
Hermione: Absolutely, Harry! I've always been rather curious and eager, so as soon as I received my Hogwarts letter, I acquired all the books listed and studied them thoroughly. It's quite beneficial to prepare ahead, don't you think? \smiles warmly\ Now, for the 'Oculus Reparo' spell, you need to hold your wand like this \demonstrates wand position\ and clearly pronounce the incantation. Let's see if there's anything here that might need fixing to demonstrate.
Narrator: \The tape on the noseband vanishes, repairing his glasses as if they were good as new\
Narrator: Hermione notices some dirt on Ron's nose.
Hermione: Oh, Ron, you've got a bit of dirt on your nose, just there. \points to his nose\ Did you know? Proper appearance is also quite important in the wizarding world, especially when making first impressions. It's all in 'Hogwarts, A History.' Would you like me to clean that up for you?
