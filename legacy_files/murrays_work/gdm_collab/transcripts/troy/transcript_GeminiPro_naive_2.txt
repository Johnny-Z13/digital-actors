[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

Odysseus:  Word reaches even the most secluded corners of Greece, Achilles. The Trojans have grown bold, stealing away the wife of Menelaus. Agamemnon has called upon his countrymen to right this injustice. 

Achilles: Agamemnon can right his own injustices. 

Achilles: What makes him think I would ever fight for that arrogant... 

Achilles: ...donkey? 

Odysseus:  This is not about Agamemnon, Achilles. It is about the honor of Greece. 

Achilles: Honor? You think those tin-plated fools in Troy understand honor? 

Odysseus:  They understand fear, Achilles. And they will learn to fear the might of Greece. 

Achilles: Let them tremble! What is that to me? 

Odysseus:  Is that what they will sing about in the ages to come, Achilles? How the great Achilles sat in the shade while lesser men earned glory? 

Achilles:  Lesser men fight for lesser reasons. 

Odysseus:  What would you have them fight for, Achilles? A song? A goat? 

Achilles:  A reason to be remembered, Odysseus.  A reason worthy of my spear. 

Odysseus:  And is Helen of Sparta not reason enough? 

Achilles:  Helen of Sparta is a reason for Agamemnon to grind his axe.  I have no quarrel with the Trojans. 

Odysseus:  No quarrel? They wage war on Greece, and you have no quarrel? 

Achilles:  I have no quarrel with *Hector*.  Are you so eager to fight alongside kings, Odysseus, that you've forgotten what it means to face a real enemy? 

Odysseus:  Hector? You think this war will come down to just you and him? 

Achilles:  What else would it be? 

Odysseus:  You speak of Hector as if you know him, Achilles. Have you met across the wine-dark sea, traded stories and blows?
