[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

[Corky]: Yeah, I remember. You're Caesar's girl, right?
[Violet]: That's right. I brought you some coffee. I hope you like it black.
[Corky]: Thanks. I do.
[Violet]: I was hoping we could talk for a moment. Do you have time?
[Corky]: Sure, what's on your mind?
[Violet]: Well, I was wondering if you could do me a small favor.
[Corky]: What kind of favor?
[Violet]: I was hoping you could avoid using your power tools at night. The noise carries, and it's been keeping me up.
[Corky]: I see. I'll try to keep it down. Is there a particular time that works better for you?
[Violet]: During the day would be great. I'm usually out running errands then. Maybe we could work out a schedule?
[Corky]: Sure, we can work something out. I'm usually here during the day anyway, working on my truck.
[Violet]: Oh, you have a truck? What kind is it?
[Corky]: It's a '63 Chevy. Real classic. Been fixing her up myself.
[Violet]: That sounds impressive. I'd love to see it sometime. Are you a mechanic?
[Corky]: Not professionally, but I know my way around an engine. It's just something I picked up over the years.
[Violet]: That's really interesting. I've always admired people who can work with their hands. Maybe you could teach me a thing or two sometime?
[Corky]: Sure, I could show you a few things. But I gotta warn you, it can get pretty messy. You might not want to wear those nice clothes.
[Violet]: Oh, don't worry about me. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I'm tougher than I look.
[Corky]: Is that right? Well, I guess we'll have to see about that. You free this afternoon?
