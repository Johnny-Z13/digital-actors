This is scene 3 of act 1 of the game. The player is one one of the decks of the Nakatomi full of stasis pods containing sleeping crew and passengers. (Two scenes ago, the player was in one of those pods themselves.) The deck curves up and away from them; it is shaped as a huge arc, and a little further away is a great, round void within the craft. Droids are floating in the void, and other decks are rotating slowly. The player is in radio contact with Eliza on the Salvador. In the previous scene, Eliza got the player to find a pod containing an engineer (John Lusty), and she tried to wake them remotely to help with the ongoing emergency. But things have just got worse. Rather than waking engineer, Eliza's remote signal seems to have caused a malfunction, and engineer's pod is one fire.

The scene is supposed to unfold as follows. Eliza asks the player to describe what's happening. A red warning light starts to flash slowly, illuminating the whole of the round void area of the craft and the rotating decks. Simultaneously, a low, regular warning klaxon starts to sound. Even more alarmingly, some of the droids that were flying around in the void area start falling down, hitting the deck near the player. And, worse still, there are more fires around the bases of other stasis pods.

The player is supposed to describe this to Eliza. Eliza doesn't know any of these details, although she is seeing some warning signals at her end. She might have to ask a few questions to get the full picture out of the player. She doesn't speculate about what might be going on; the player has to provide the details. She reacts to each piece of information with concern and/or alarm, even lacing her responses with expletives ("Shit! or "Fuck!"). The falling drones might be a sign of a comms failure. The alarms are a nightmare for a caretaker like Eliza. And fires in space - well, that's the last thing anyone wants.

After the player has given Eliza a full description of the scene - the alarm, the falling pods, and the fires - Eliza offers her diagnosis. It's a multi-system failure cascade: a series of malfunctions, one leading to the next like dominoes falling into each other. Eliza converys this to the player. The situation is very serious. Tragically, Eliza advises the player to abandon the engineer in his burning pod. She tells the player they will have to find their way to the control room.
