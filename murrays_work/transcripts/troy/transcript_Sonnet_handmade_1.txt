[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

[Odysseus]: I come on behalf of Agamemnon, to seek your strength for our war against Troy.
[Achilles]: Agamemnon? That arrogant fool thinks he can summon me like a common soldier? Tell him I've spilled enough blood for his glory.
[Odysseus]: This isn't about Agamemnon's glory, Achilles. Think of the songs they'll sing of you when you defeat the mighty Hector of Troy.
[Achilles]: Songs? I've heard enough songs. What I want is respect, not empty praise from fawning poets. Hector can keep his glory.
[Odysseus]: And what of Patroclus? He's determined to sail with us. Without you there to protect him, how long do you think he'll last against Troy's finest?
[Achilles]: Patroclus is a man grown, Odysseus. He can make his own choices, and face the consequences. I won't be manipulated by your concern for him.
[Odysseus]: Very well, Achilles. But remember, great heroes are not born in times of peace. Troy offers you a chance at immortality that may never come again.
[Achilles]: Immortality? I've bathed in glory and tasted the blood of countless foes. What more can Troy offer that I haven't already claimed on a hundred battlefields?
[Odysseus]: The chance to be remembered not just as a great warrior, Achilles, but as the savior of Greece. This war will shape the destiny of nations.
[Achilles]: Savior of Greece? Ha! Let Greece save itself. I've seen how quickly they forget their heroes once the battle is won.
[Odysseus]: Your bitterness blinds you, Achilles. This war is larger than any of us, and history will judge harshly those who stood aside.
[Achilles]: History can judge all it wants, Odysseus. I've seen enough of war to know its true face, and it's far uglier than the poets' pretty words.
[Odysseus]: Then perhaps it's time you showed the world the true face of war, Achilles. Let your actions speak louder than any poet's words ever could.
[Achilles]: Fine words, Odysseus, but they don't change the fact that Agamemnon treats his allies like dogs. Why should I risk my life for a man who shows no honor?
[Odysseus]: Because, Achilles, this war isn't about Agamemnon. It's about the honor of all Greece, and the legacy you'll leave behind. Can you truly stand idle while history unfolds without you?
[Achilles]: Legacy? Honor? You speak of lofty ideals, Odysseus, but I've seen how quickly they crumble in the face of greed and politics. What guarantee do I have that this war won't be just another exercise in futility?
[Odysseus]: There are no guarantees in war, Achilles, only opportunities. And this, my friend, is the opportunity of a lifetime. Will you let it slip through your fingers because of past grievances?
[Achilles]: You're clever with words, Odysseus, but your arguments ring hollow. I've seen too many "opportunities" turn to ash. Give me one reason, one true reason, why I should believe this time will be different.
[Odysseus]: Because, Achilles, this time you have the power to shape the outcome. Your presence alone could turn the tide of this war and cement your place in history. Will you let that power go to waste?
