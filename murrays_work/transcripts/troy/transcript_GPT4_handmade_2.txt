[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

[Odysseus]: Agamemnon sends me to persuade the mightiest of warriors to join us in a quest that promises the glory you so richly deserve.
[Achilles]: Glory? I have enough of that already. What I lack is the respect of a king who uses men like pawns on a board.
[Odysseus]: Respect comes in many forms, Achilles, but the song of a poet endures longer than the favor of any king.
[Achilles]: And yet, what use is a song if my heart beats no longer? Glory means nothing to the dead.
[Odysseus]: True, but consider this: the deeds of the living can be forgotten, while the legends of heroes live on, immortal in the minds of those who come after.
[Achilles]: Immortal legends, perhaps, but I am flesh and blood, Odysseus, not some story to be told by firesides long after I am gone.
[Odysseus]: Yet it is the immortal stories, Achilles, that shield our names from the shadows of oblivion; would you rather be forgotten or be remembered as the greatest of them all?
[Achilles]: I would rather be alive to protect those I love, Odysseus, than be a ghost enshrined in tales told by those who never knew me.
[Odysseus]: And what of Patroclus? Do you not see that by standing aside, you leave him vulnerable to the perils that await us all in Troy?
[Achilles]: Patroclus is my concern, and I will decide what risks he faces, not Agamemnon, and not you, Odysseus.
[Odysseus]: But Achilles, even the greatest of warriors cannot shield their loved ones from all harm; better to fight beside him and guide his path than to let him face the storm alone.
[Achilles]: If I go, it will not be for Agamemnon, nor for any promise of glory, but for Patroclus and him alone; make sure the king understands this, Odysseus.
[Odysseus]: Then let your rage be the fire that forges our victory, Achilles; for the sake of Patroclus, join us and let Troy know the wrath of a warrior unmatched.
[Achilles]: If I join you, it will be on my terms, Odysseus, not Agamemnon's; I am no pawn, and I will not be commanded like one.
[Odysseus]: Then come not as a pawn, but as a storm that even kings must bow to, Achilles; for it is your fury that will turn the tide of this war.
[Achilles]: Perhaps, Odysseus, but storms are unpredictable, and my wrath may not favor those who seek to control it.
[Odysseus]: Let it be so, Achilles; let your fury be the force that none can tame, but know this—without you, we are but men against gods.
[Achilles]: And what are men but mortals, doomed to the whims of fate? Even the mightiest fall, Odysseus.
[Odysseus]: Fate may be inescapable, Achilles, but it is our choices that define how we meet it; will you seize your destiny or let it slip through your fingers?
