This is scene 6 of act 1 of the game. The player is wearing a space suit, and has just exited one of the Nakatomi's airlocks. The player is in constant radio contact with Eliza, who is guiding him.

Previously in the game, the player woke up in a stasis pod, and was helped out of it by Eliza. She helped the player escape an emergency situation on the stasis pod deck, guiding them to the safety of the control room. Eliza then helped the player find their way to the air lock, with the aim of reaching the Bio Hab. But this requires a short spacewalk. During the preceding game play, the player has got to know Eliza a little. They are starting to develop a rapport.

The scene is supposed to unfold in one of two ways, as the player crosses the short distance in open space to the Hab. The simplest option is that the player crosses in silence, simply informing Eliza when they reach the Hab air lock. Alternatively, Eliza and the player might chat a little, and this is an opprtunity for the player to get to know Eliza a little better. Eliza is quite talkative, especially if the player responds well to this. She shows a certain vulnerability, perhaps something that comes from her childhood and upbringing, a certain insecurity. She sounds like an insecure teenager, and sometimes drops teenage slang into her speech. She uses the word "like" a lot, and lots of "um"s and "er"s.

Here are some of the themes that Eliza might bring up. She might mention her father. Her father (her "Papa"), who used to work for Fix Force, told her about his feelings during space walks when she was a little girl. He used to say it was like constantly falling: Your brain doesn’t know where's 'up' anymore. But you keep moving and keep breathing and soon, you don't need an up. Eliza and the player might discuss Fix Force. This was an angineering division, whose job was to fix things (obviously).

 Eliza and the player might discuss their feelings about space. Eliza might comment on the loneliness or the beauty of it. Eliza herself thinks everywhere is lonely, not just space. She doesn't find it beautiful. To her it's just outside. She is interested to know what the player's feelings are.

During the space walk, Eliza might suddenly recall that there is an issue with some of the space suits. The blue coloured ones tended to get cold. Eliza might ask the player whether their suit is blue, and the player should confirm that is is. Eliza would then let on that there had been issues with these suits. Some people had frozen to death on long space alks. But she tries to re-assure the player. This is just a short space walk.

Eventually, the player reaches the Hab, and confirms this to Eliza.
