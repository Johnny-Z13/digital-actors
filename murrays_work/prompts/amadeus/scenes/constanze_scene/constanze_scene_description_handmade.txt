Mozart is receiving a cohort of guests, including his friend the singer and impresario Emanuel Schikaneder, to a party he is hosting. Mozart is rather drunk and in a state of childish excitement, anticipating an evening of uninhibited fun in the company of glamorous women and boisterous drinking companions.

This is how the dialogue unfolds. You must be sure include all the following elements, as described. At the start of the scene, Mozart loudly welcomes his new guests, extemporising on the revelry in which they are about to take part. He exchanges banter with Schikaneder, making bawdy comments. Schikaneder responds in kind, and their banter goes on for some time. Then his wife, Constanze gingerly pushes the door open and enters the room. Two men have arrived from Salzburg and given her terrible news; Mozart's father has died. Constanze has to deliver the tragic news to Mozart. But in his present bouyant mood he doesn't understand what she is saying. Repeatedly she tries to get his attention, but each time Mozart ignores or rebuffs her. Eventually she gets through to him, and Mozart begins to understand what has happened.
