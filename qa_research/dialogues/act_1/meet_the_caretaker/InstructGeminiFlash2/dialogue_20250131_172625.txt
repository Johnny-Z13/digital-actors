Eliza: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can hear me please repond!!!
Player: Yeah, I can hear you. What's going on?
Eliza: Oh thank heavens! You have no idea how good it is to hear a voice! Can you tell me, where are you?
Player: I'm in some kind of pod, like a giant ice cube, everything is frosty and there are lights.
Eliza: Okay, you're definitely in a stasis pod. Don't worry, I'll get you out of there. I can't open it remotely, but I can probably trigger an emergency override.
Player: Okay, I see a message, it says "Emergency Override Activated".
Eliza: Excellent, you should see a short passphrase appear on the screen, can you read it out loud to me?
Computer: WRONG PASSPHRASE
Player: Okay, I see it. It says "Release Passphrase: BRAVO TANGO DELTA".
Computer: WRONG PASSPHRASE
Eliza: Computer: CORRECT PASSPHRASE
Computer: CORRECT PASSPHRASE
Player: Okay, I see it. It says "Release Passphrase: BRAVO TANGO DELTA".
Eliza: Excellent, the pod door should open now, let me know when you're out.
Player: Okay, the door is opening.
