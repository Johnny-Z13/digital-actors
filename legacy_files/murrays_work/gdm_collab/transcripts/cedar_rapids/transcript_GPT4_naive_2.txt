[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

Ronald: [Ronald]: Well, when I saw that guy coming at you, I remembered a scene from "The Wire" and just channeled my inner Omar.
Tim: [Tim]: You really had me fooled, man. I thought we were done for.
Dean: [Dean]: Yeah, no kidding. I can't believe that worked.
Joan: [Joan]: Honestly, Ronald, you missed your calling. You should be in Hollywood.
Ronald: [Ronald]: Ha, Hollywood, huh? Maybe after all this I should consider a career change.
Tim: [Tim]: I mean, seriously, how did you keep a straight face through all that?
Ronald: [Ronald]: Years of practice in front of the mirror, my friend.
Dean: [Dean]: Well, whatever it was, it saved our asses. I owe you one, Ronald.
Joan: [Joan]: We all do. That was some quick thinking back there.
Tim: [Tim]: It's crazy to think how all those acting classes paid off in a real-life situation.
Ronald: [Ronald]: Yeah, who knew all those community theater gigs would come in handy someday?
Tim: [Tim]: Guess it just goes to show, you never know when your weird hobbies will save your life.
Dean: [Dean]: Makes me wonder what other hidden talents we've all got tucked away.
Joan: [Joan]: Well, I can tap dance, but I don't think that's going to help us in any more life-or-death situations.
Tim: [Tim]: Hey, you never know, Joan. We might need a distraction, and your tap dancing could be just the thing.
Ronald: [Ronald]: That's right, Joan. Keep those tap shoes handy.
Dean: [Dean]: And here I thought my dad jokes were my only redeeming quality.
Joan: [Joan]: Oh, Dean, those dad jokes might be the reason we all survive one day.
Tim: [Tim]: Yeah, nothing like a good laugh to keep the fear at bay.
