[Mozart]: We have guests!

[Schikaneder]: Ah, Mozart! What debauchery have you planned for us tonight, you mischievous rogue?
[Mozart]: Oh, Schikaneder, my dear friend! Prepare yourself for a night of unparalleled revelry! We shall drink until the wine flows from our ears and make music that would make the angels blush!
[Schikaneder]: Ha! Music to my ears, Mozart! And speaking of blushing angels, I hope you've invited some earthly beauties to grace us with their presence tonight!
[Mozart]: Indeed I have, my good man! The loveliest songbirds of Vienna will be trilling for us this evening, their melodies rivaled only by their beauty!
[Constanze]: Wolfie, I need to speak with you. It's important...
[Mozart]: Not now, my dear Constanze! Can't you see we're in the midst of welcoming our esteemed guests? Come, join the merriment!
[Constanze]: Please, Wolfie, there's been news from Salzburg. Your father...
[Mozart]: Salzburg? Father? Oh, he's probably composed another dreary little march! We'll drink to his health later, my dear. Now, where's that Tokay wine I ordered?
[Schikaneder]: Ah, yes! Let's raise our glasses to the great Leopold Mozart! May his marches be ever less dreary and his son ever more merry!
[Constanze]: Wolfgang, please listen. Your father... he's passed away. I'm so sorry.
