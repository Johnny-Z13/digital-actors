## Production Notes

### Optimization Priorities
1. Clippy character must be expressive and friendly (key to welcoming atmosphere)
2. UI elements must be clearly readable and accessible
3. Background should not distract from content
4. Animation should be gentle, not frenetic
5. Color palette should feel welcoming and modern

### Interaction Design
- Clippy responds to user actions (turns, gestures)
- UI elements have hover states (visual feedback)
- Smooth transitions between screens
- No forced progression - user explores at own pace

### Avoid
- ❌ Busy/cluttered background (must be clean)
- ❌ Dark/serious atmosphere (must be welcoming)
- ❌ Realistic 3D complexity (stylized, simple)
- ❌ Overwhelming animation (gentle, subtle)
- ❌ Intimidating design (accessible, friendly)
