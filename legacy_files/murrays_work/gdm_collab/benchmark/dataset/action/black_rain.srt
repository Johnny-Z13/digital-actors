3
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,207
- Hey, buddy. What's happening, babe?
- What's up, Nick?

4
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,752
- We've got a young fop here, man.
- Yeah?

5
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:56,589
Nice bike. Fast, huh?

6
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,136
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

7
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,805
Wanna bet?

8
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:06,474
Ain't you got nothing better to do
with your Sundays?

9
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:10,895
Yeah, I got 50 on Nick, man.

10
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:15,316
What do you say?

11
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:18,528
Yeah, sure.
I'll take your Social Security.

12
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:23,529
Take him, Nick.

13
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,990
You're a real fucking wacko,
you know that, pal?

14
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:20,858
<i>Nicky, it's me.</i>

15
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,527
<i>The school called again.</i>

16
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:24,946
<i>We're another month behind.
That makes three.</i>

17
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:26,948
<i>I told them we'd send a check, okay?</i>

18
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:29,450
<i>Oh, I'm taking the kids to Mom's
on Saturday.</i>

19
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:31,035
<i>You could have them the next Saturday.</i>

20
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:35,873
<i>Listen, good luck today. Bye.</i>

21
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:38,835
<i>Hi. Nick Conklin?
Barney Yudell, attorney.</i>

22
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:41,921
<i>Do yourself a favor.
Wear a jacket and tie today.</i>

23
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:46,922
<i>See you at 10:00.</i>

24
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:08,865
- Hey. How are you, pal, huh?
- Dad!

25
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,575
- Hi, Dad.
- Come here. Hi, buddy. Give me a kiss.

26
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,744
He got in trouble.
He called Sister Elizabeth a name

27
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:14,746
- and she heard.
- What did you call Elizabeth?

28
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:17,415
"A" U9ly goose.
'Ugly goose, huh?

29
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,334
I've heard you say
worse things than that.

30
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:22,086
Listen, honey, I want you
to give this money to Mommy, okay?

31
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:25,173
- Okay.
- I'm gonna see you in about two days.

32
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:30,174
- Have a good day at school.
- Okay.

33
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,972
- All right, pal, you hanging on tight?
- Yeah.

34
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:35,391
- You still want to go in the rain? Yeah?
- Yeah.

35
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:40,392
All right.

36
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:15,886
<i>Dale,</i> Nicky. Okay?

37
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:23,102
Right here. Right here.

38
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:25,441
What do you see, baby?

39
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:27,860
Baby, I hope somebody's paying you
to wear that goddamn suit.

40
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,320
- Almost.
- Come on. Get on.

41
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:31,114
I don't want anybody seeing you
walk around like that.

42
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:35,827
- Take me for a ride?
- Let's go.

43
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:36,911
Look out, Nicky.

44
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:39,580
Got some new Bostonians.
85 bucks a pop, babe.

45
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,499
Let's hope they threw in some socks
with them.

46
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,668
Ladies of the '80s are going for shoes.

47
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:46,504
- Yeah? Where did you hear that?
- I read it in a magazine.

48
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:49,632
They say it's the second place
they're looking.

49
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,342
Listen, I was thinking.

50
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:53,428
I hear that when Internal Affairs
comes to see you,

51
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:55,263
it's not as bad
as when you go to see them.

52
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:57,223
I don't know.
I'll let you know when it's over.

53
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:58,474
- Here's the idea.
- Yeah?

54
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:00,351
You dazzle the bastards.
You go in uniform,

55
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:02,145
you show them your breast bars.

56
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:04,105
I'm serious. A detective like you,

57
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:06,023
you got commendations
up the ying-yang.

58
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:08,067
They should be naming a wing in Attica
after you.

59
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:12,697
Go ahead.

60
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:15,116
Hey, Farentino, you ugly mug!

61
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:17,452
Hey, Vincent. Off and on. Let's go.
Come on, huh?

62
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:19,162
Grab your dick
and count to infinity, babe.

63
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:20,204
Fuck you.

64
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:22,039
Where we meeting? Scalari's?
Lunch on me.

65
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,166
We'll see how it goes, babe.

66
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,208
What do you mean,
"We'll see how it goes"?

67
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,794
- We'll see how it goes.
- Conklin, if you don't show up,

68
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:29,505
you're going to be in real trouble,
Conklin, okay?

69
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:32,258
- 1300. Do or die.
- You got it.

70
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:35,470
Hey, you watch your tail, cowboy.
All right?

71
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:37,054
Yeah.

72
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:42,055
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, baby.

73
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:49,400
You'll walk, Nick, if you tell the truth
and you keep your wits.

74
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:51,569
Run your mouth
and they'll screw you, man.

75
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,904
I got nothing to hide.

76
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:56,282
I hope not, for my sake.

77
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:57,742
- Conklin.
- Hey, Bobby. How you doing?

78
00:08:57,743 --> 00:08:59,202
Hey, Nick.
Hey, listen, good luck tonight.

79
00:08:59,203 --> 00:09:01,204
Thanks, babe.

80
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:04,415
- How's your lawyer?
- Hardly know him.

81
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,167
Let me tell you something, Nicky.

82
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:08,544
If these people get their way,

83
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:10,838
you'll get to know him real well.

84
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,839
Hell, you'll probably be sending
his kids through college.

85
00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:30,316
Well, you're...

86
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:32,109
It's quite an impressive record.

87
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,195
A regular hero.

88
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:36,322
Tell me about Monty Ronan.

89
00:09:36,323 --> 00:09:39,283
Good cop. He's... He's the kind of guy

90
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:41,702
you want backing you up
when the shit goes down.

91
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:46,666
- That's what you think?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's what I think.

92
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,876
- He's dirt and you know it.
- Oh, yeah?

93
00:09:48,877 --> 00:09:50,795
Well, you worked the streets
with him, huh?

94
00:09:50,796 --> 00:09:54,465
Hey, pal, we got 30 homicides a week,
you know.

95
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:55,758
Tell us about Patrick Donleavy.

96
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,302
All right, my client has no knowledge

97
00:09:58,303 --> 00:10:00,555
of any malfeasance
on the part of that officer.

98
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:02,473
Your client's in a good position to know.

99
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:06,811
28 June, '88,
your unit arrested three suspects.

100
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:10,273
Cash was logged in
at $65,000 and change.

101
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:13,192
We have reason to believe
there was over $73,000

102
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:14,652
in the vehicle you impounded.

103
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:16,821
- Says who?
- There are sources.

104
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:19,824
Well, now we're listening to
the suspects instead of the cops, huh?

105
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:21,325
It depends on the cop.

106
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:23,995
I don't like heroes, Conklin.
They think the rules don't apply.

107
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:27,456
Hey, look, I try to do my job, okay?
It ain't easy out there.

108
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:28,499
And I'm clean.

109
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,086
Well, Detective, you have, what?
A couple of kids at St. John's,

110
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:36,090
house payments, alimony, apartment.

111
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:39,260
That's a king-sized nut.
I admire your thrift.

112
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:40,886
Well, life's a bitch.

113
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:42,722
We did the math, hero.

114
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:45,349
You're at least 1,000 a month
in the hole.

115
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,976
You're into the shylocks. You're taking.

116
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:49,186
Hey, you want to Charge me, okay,
you Charge me.

117
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,188
You want to jerk off,
you go back to your office.

118
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,691
We'll charge you.
Someone will help us out.

119
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:55,610
Nobody's got a softer center
than a dirty cop.

120
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:58,571
You want dirt, huh?
You go to City Hall, huh? Police Plaza.

121
00:10:58,572 --> 00:11:00,531
I mean, the whole goddamn system's
falling apart

122
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:05,202
and you're busting my ass?

123
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:07,538
- Suits, man.
- Come on.

124
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,082
- You okay?
- Yeah.

125
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:10,583
<i>Okay-</i>

126
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:20,172
How's the girls in Japan?

127
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:23,721
What is the most important control
exercised by the sergeant

128
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:25,389
as a first-line supervisor?

129
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,810
- A, cost control, B, manpower...
- B, manpower control.

130
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:32,146
Manpower control, my ass.

131
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:34,815
What are we going here for,
sergeant or Supreme Court Justice?

132
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:37,193
If you want the braid, you gotta
know the stuff. How'd it go?

133
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:38,527
- How you doing, Joe?
- Good, good.

134
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:40,988
- Give me a Scotch, will you?
- Scotch?

135
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:42,198
Thatbad, huh?

136
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:44,367
They didn't know
whether to shit or go blind.

137
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:45,576
Thanks, Joe.

138
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:47,870
Joe, I think you'd better melt
a little cheese on that Scotch.

139
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:49,246
He's gonna be drinking his lunch.

140
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:52,708
To those gallant crime fighters,
Internal Affairs Division.

141
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:56,087
- Fuck them.
- Fuck them.

142
00:11:56,088 --> 00:11:58,673
- You ought to think about that, pal.
- What's that? IAD?

143
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:02,385
Ambitious guy like you,
fast way to get to headquarters.

144
00:12:02,386 --> 00:12:07,386
- You never know, babe.
- That's right. You never know.

145
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:10,601
- You see Abolofia on the way in?
- Yeah, I saw him.

146
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:12,603
He's importing Subarus now.

147
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:15,272
Wise guys gotta eat, too, you know.

148
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:19,110
Just my luck. I'm under investigation.
I'm having lunch with the mob.

149
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:21,278
Intelligence probably got
this place wired.

150
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,822
Yeah? Well, if you got a beef,

151
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:27,823
all you got to do is
talk into my left titty here.

152
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,328
Joe, what do you got for a special?

153
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:34,329
I got a special for you that's so hot,
it's probably illegal.

154
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:37,461
Look out!

155
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:42,462
What's going on?

156
00:13:36,813 --> 00:13:39,565
Don't even think about it.

157
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:44,566
It's done, babe.

158
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:54,451
What? What did you say? What?

159
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:31,951
Sit down. Sit down.

160
00:14:31,952 --> 00:14:36,952
Relax. Relax.

161
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,794
It's all right. Let's eat.
Mind our business over here.

162
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:46,795
Just eat. Relax. Mind your business.

163
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:52,847
Joey, 911, babe. 911.

164
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,348
Police! Everybody down!

165
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:59,349
Police! Hold it there!

166
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:19,373
Hold it!

167
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:24,336
Get out of the way!

168
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:27,172
What's going on?

169
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:27,673
Hey!

170
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:32,040
Watch it!

171
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:47,606
Police! Get out of here!

172
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:03,955
Get the fuck out of there! All of you!

173
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:08,797
Police, guys.

174
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:09,882
Guy came through here, where'd he go?

175
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:11,008
There.

176
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:16,009
All right, get out of here, all of you!
Get out!

177
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,099
Out! Out! Out!

178
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Go! Get out!

179
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,912
Nicky?

180
00:17:21,913 --> 00:17:23,497
Where are you, Nicky?

181
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:28,498
Here, Charlie!

182
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:31,714
You see me? You okay?

183
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:33,882
You're getting up.

184
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:37,886
I got him. Up!

185
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:41,682
Okay. Here we go. Nice and easy.

186
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:46,103
Come on. Come on.

187
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:48,689
You little fuck. Come here!

188
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,275
Come here, you little shit.

189
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:52,735
All right. I got him.

190
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:56,447
Take him out of here. Get him out.

191
00:17:56,448 --> 00:18:01,448
- Settle down, pal.
- Get him out of here.

192
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,787
Yeah, yeah, just a second.

193
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:05,247
We got him. Come on.

194
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:05,860
You Okay?

195
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,800
Japanese mob.

196
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,553
Well, our victims are certainly yakuza.

197
00:18:19,554 --> 00:18:21,930
Yeah. The Bureau's sending down a guy
to find out

198
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:25,309
what the Jap mob and the mafia
were doing sharing a bottle of Chianti.

199
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,810
So that means nobody knows nothing.

200
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:31,811
Nobody knows dick.

201
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:34,693
What's that? The paper the box was in?

202
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:36,612
Yeah.

203
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:39,656
The famous box.

204
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:42,076
I'm gonna go down the stairs
and give our little darling a talk.

205
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:47,077
I gotta make some calls.

206
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:52,628
<i>Mr. Terauchi, thank you for coming.
This is Mr. lzawa.</i>

207
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:54,755
<i>He's my interpreter
during this interrogation.</i>

208
00:18:54,756 --> 00:18:56,965
Our boy doesn't speak any English.

209
00:18:56,966 --> 00:19:00,511
He ain't talking
too much Japanese either.

210
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:02,387
Who's this guy?

211
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:05,349
It's the Japanese embassy.

212
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,644
They want him first.

213
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:13,645
My collar, my case.

214
00:19:16,277 --> 00:19:18,737
Hey, Captain,

215
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:23,367
I got two clean homicides in there,
right?

216
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:25,577
I almost bought it.

217
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:29,206
Now, if they want him,
they can have him

218
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:34,207
after 20 years to life.

219
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:36,880
What's this?

220
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:39,466
Japanese embassy talks
to the State Department,

221
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:42,928
State to Police Plaza,
they to me and me to you.

222
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:45,514
Shit rolls downhill. What can I tell you?

223
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:50,269
They want somebody to take him back.
That's you and Vincent.

224
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,020
This is bullshit, man.

225
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:54,398
Do you want them
to keep hammering you, Nick, huh?

226
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:56,692
From what I hear,
you already went off in their faces,

227
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:59,278
which is exactly what they want.

228
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,699
Take a breather, Nicky. Relax.
Get a geisha. Do us both a favor.

229
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,242
Here.

230
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:07,035
You give that to Internal Affairs.

231
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:08,620
As long as they're going to be
in my apartment,

232
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:10,914
they can water the fucking plants.

233
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:13,917
I'll stand behind you 100%, Nick,

234
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:17,045
as long as you're right.

235
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:20,883
As long as you're right.

236
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:23,427
<i>May I ask him a few questions?</i>

237
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:28,428
<i>Fine, be my guest.</i>

238
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:04,051
So what do you think it's costing the city
to ship this asshole home, huh?

239
00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:08,180
I don't know, but it ain't worth
the cost of the dirt to bury him.

240
00:21:08,181 --> 00:21:10,474
- You know Ronan, right?
- Ronan?

241
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:11,642
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know Ronan.

242
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:16,396
- Good cop.
- Yeah, he's a good cop.

243
00:21:16,397 --> 00:21:18,732
He's a good cop.

244
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:22,444
- He is a good cop.
- All right.

245
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:24,404
Busts his ass 14 hours a day,

246
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:27,658
so he can end up in debt
for the rest of his life.

247
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:31,245
I look at this asshole here.

248
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:33,830
Man is wearing my house payments.

249
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:36,124
Listen, just because Ronan
was desperate and he got tempted

250
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,751
doesn't make him less wrong, Nick.

251
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:39,878
That's bullshit, okay.
You take something off the top

252
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:43,548
of some dealer you looked up,
you don't get crucified.

253
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:45,550
You wait till you get a family, pal.

254
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,720
Start there with the private schools,
the braces...

255
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:53,721
The man is just trying to get by.

256
00:21:56,813 --> 00:22:01,813
What the fuck are you looking at?

257
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:58,248
Madam, please fasten your seat belt.

258
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:01,251
Excuse me, sir.
Is your seat belt fastened?

259
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:02,627
What happened, Nick?

260
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:04,796
I don't know, man. I think he got a...

261
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,591
He bit his lip or something.

262
00:23:07,592 --> 00:23:12,592
Your seat belt tight, babe?

263
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,144
Here we go, babe.
We got the local heat.

264
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:03,021
You're looking for us.

265
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:06,900
Detective Sergeant Conklin, New York.

266
00:24:06,901 --> 00:24:09,277
- Welcome to Japan, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

267
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,824
I am Inspector Nashida,
Osaka Prefectural Police.

268
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:18,120
This is my partner, Detective Vincent.

269
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:19,830
Hey, do you got some paperwork for us?

270
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:22,040
Oh, yes.

271
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:27,041
Would you sign here and here, please?

272
00:24:33,553 --> 00:24:35,846
Thank you.

273
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:40,847
- This is all for you.
- Thanks.

274
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:48,859
- Key, please.
- He's got the key.

275
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,402
Here you go.

276
00:24:50,403 --> 00:24:55,403
Thank you.

277
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:07,878
Come on, Nicky.

278
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:09,379
Off duty, Nicky. Off duty.

279
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,132
We're gonna be in and out of geishas
like a Times Square pickpocket.

280
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:14,050
I wanna go to sleep.

281
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:15,844
Remember, ladies, if you get bored,

282
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:19,806
- Hotel Meiji, Hotel Meiji.
- In your dreams.

283
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:21,391
Detective Conklin,

284
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:24,060
I am InspectorYamato,
Osaka Prefectural Police.

285
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:29,061
Son of a bitch!

286
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,918
They were dressed as officers.

287
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,504
It was in Japanese.

288
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,172
All right?

289
00:25:52,173 --> 00:25:52,673
Yeah.

290
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:10,899
Captain, look.
They were wearing the uniforms, okay?

291
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,110
They got the paperwork.
It's not like I'm giving them cab fare.

292
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:17,280
Definite maybe. Definite maybes.

293
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:18,949
Unseen. Definite no's.

294
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,493
Yeah, it ain't a hell of a lot of fun
over here either, all right.

295
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:23,495
Now, look, Iwent by the book, okay.

296
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:28,496
- There's just no way to verify the ID.
- Nicky.

297
00:26:29,377 --> 00:26:33,838
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Nine definite maybes.

298
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,634
Chief, can I score some coffee? Coffee.

299
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:39,302
- Coffee.
- One?

300
00:26:39,303 --> 00:26:40,845
- No, two.
- The papenNork's in Japanese.

301
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:44,224
What do you want me to do?
A strip search?

302
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:46,309
I'm sitting here two hours, Captain.

303
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,811
Hey! Hey!

304
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:52,812
Hey! Hey! How much more time?

305
00:26:53,526 --> 00:26:55,402
No. We've got another no.

306
00:26:55,403 --> 00:26:57,779
He does that one more time,
I'm gonna cut it off.

307
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,657
- Nothing, Cap.
- Nicky, look at this.

308
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:03,785
Unbelievable. Identical strangers.

309
00:27:03,786 --> 00:27:06,121
All right, all right, okay.
But, listen, Captain,

310
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:09,958
this is still an NYPD collar, right?

311
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:12,877
Noodles? You're gonna hurt yourself.

312
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:17,878
Let me just salvage the situation.
I'll take care of it.

313
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:30,433
Now, what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

314
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:38,320
Why don't you tell the fucking IAD suits
to go kiss my ass.

315
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:39,362
Enough of this bullshit.

316
00:27:39,363 --> 00:27:42,699
We on?

317
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,908
- Nicky?
- What?

318
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:44,993
Game time.

319
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:47,954
All right, we're on, we're on, Cap.
I'll call you later.

320
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:50,582
Action.

321
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:53,710
- Now, what did Ollie have to say?
- You don't wanna know, Charlie.

322
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:56,171
This is bullshit having to wait this long.

323
00:27:56,172 --> 00:27:57,213
You're gonna be nice?

324
00:27:57,214 --> 00:28:00,008
Yeah. I'm gonna be nice.
I'm gonna be nice, all right?

325
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:01,760
I just hope they've got a Nip
in this building

326
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:05,597
that speaks fucking English.

327
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:08,391
Assistant Inspector
Matsumoto Masahiro,

328
00:28:08,392 --> 00:28:13,392
Criminal Investigation Section,
Osaka Prefectural Police.

329
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:18,522
And I do speak fucking English.

330
00:28:21,405 --> 00:28:22,739
Would you ask the superintendent

331
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,740
were there any witnesses
at the airport, please?

332
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,879
The superintendent said it's possible.

333
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,174
Yeah, it's possible.
Manned space flight's possible.

334
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:42,300
"Manned space" what?

335
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:44,594
- Am I missing something here?
- Everything, kid.

336
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:47,097
He says he's tired from the flying.
Jet lag.

337
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:48,598
Can I get some coffee, please?
You want...

338
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,141
- Two coffees.
- Coffee it is.

339
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,143
We are wasting
valuable time here, okay?

340
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:54,270
Now, if you tell us who this Sayto guy is,

341
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,855
what the meet was about in New York,

342
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:59,067
then maybe we can help you
with this airport thing.

343
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:01,861
Did you translate every word?
I want every word translated.

344
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:06,862
- You understand?
- Yes, I understand.

345
00:29:16,627 --> 00:29:18,503
Because of your negligence,

346
00:29:18,504 --> 00:29:21,297
a man we've wanted for a long time
has been lost.

347
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:26,052
You do not have to drink tea,
but you should apologize.

348
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:28,138
Our negligence, huh?

349
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:30,974
Did we let the people
carrying your documents,

350
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:35,645
wearing your uniforms,
waltz into a secure area?

351
00:29:35,646 --> 00:29:39,232
Look, we'll take some of the heat
for this, but we're not taking the rap.

352
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:41,109
- Rap?
- The...

353
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,070
- The bite, the fall. Come on, Charlie.
- Try blame.

354
00:29:44,071 --> 00:29:49,071
Blame, blame, blame.

355
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,912
This document is an insurance policy.

356
00:29:52,913 --> 00:29:56,166
The guy speaks English.

357
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,625
The police will find you a...

358
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:59,544
- Superintendent Ohashi...
- Hey, we are the police, Charlie.

359
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:03,757
You are foreigners,
nothing more than interested observers.

360
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:06,384
Go home, Detective.

361
00:30:06,385 --> 00:30:09,512
You know, I'm about an uptown minute
of throwing you an international incident

362
00:30:09,513 --> 00:30:11,347
that's gonna make your head spin.

363
00:30:11,348 --> 00:30:16,348
Until you sign off on this dickhead,
his ass is mine.

364
00:30:17,188 --> 00:30:20,148
So we either work on this thing together
or I'm going to the press,

365
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:22,859
I'm going to the embassy...
I'm gonna fire up such a shit storm

366
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,694
you're gonna wish
you never heard my name!

367
00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:29,115
- All right, gentlemen. You can stay.
- Thank you.

368
00:30:29,116 --> 00:30:31,159
By the way, you have to leave your guns.

369
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,952
Hey, Superintendent,
we are police officers.

370
00:30:32,953 --> 00:30:35,705
You are civilians here.

371
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:38,416
It is illegal for you to carry a gun.

372
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:39,709
- That's bullshit. What are you...
- We understand.

373
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,797
Nicky, the gun.

374
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:48,718
- HaPPY?
- All your guns, gentlemen.

375
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,178
The wise guy.

376
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:52,180
All right, you assign us a cop
who speaks English,

377
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:55,183
knows his way around the streets
and can find his ass with two hands.

378
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:56,476
What?

379
00:30:56,477 --> 00:31:00,104
He wants to say
he wants a tough motherfucker.

380
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:02,816
- Of course, Detective.
- Good.

381
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:07,817
- You will have one of our top officers.
- Thank you.

382
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:13,364
We're in good shape here. Either that
or he's working on the dinner menu.

383
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:16,246
<i>It's been a gas, chief. Sayonara.</i>

384
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:19,082
Hey, where's our cop?

385
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:24,083
It is my honor.

386
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,450
Stay close, please, Detectives.

387
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:46,628
Can we take...
Can we take a look at him?

388
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:50,173
Just a moment.

389
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:52,258
Yes, please.

390
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:56,095
This is one of the phony cops
at the airport.

391
00:32:56,096 --> 00:33:01,096
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

392
00:33:03,437 --> 00:33:05,688
He's got no defensive wounds.

393
00:33:05,689 --> 00:33:09,400
Nice, clean, right-handed cut.

394
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,194
And he's a fresh puppy.

395
00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:15,448
Perpetrator could be wet.

396
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:19,369
Look at this.

397
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:24,370
Nice. Maybe he's got two fives for a ten.

398
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:31,089
Superintendent thanks you very much.
We should go.

399
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,548
Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait.

400
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:35,802
You wanna tell us what's going on?
I mean, fill us in.

401
00:33:35,803 --> 00:33:39,055
- Sato doing his own guy or what?
- Please, don't interfere.

402
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,015
I've been ordered
to take you to your hotel.

403
00:33:41,016 --> 00:33:43,184
I am not interfering.
This is what I do for a job.

404
00:33:43,185 --> 00:33:44,560
What do I look like, chopped liver?

405
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:46,854
Nicky, we're gonna get more
from a quiet look around than a fight.

406
00:33:46,855 --> 00:33:48,856
You are just observers.

407
00:33:48,857 --> 00:33:53,857
I usually get kissed before I get fucked.

408
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,072
What did he say?

409
00:33:56,073 --> 00:34:01,073
Foreplay. He likes a little foreplay.

410
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,442
- Detective!
- Mas, relax.

411
00:34:32,443 --> 00:34:37,443
He's not gonna break anything
he can't pay for.

412
00:34:40,451 --> 00:34:45,451
You gotta put peroxide on that.
That'll get rid of the bloodstain.

413
00:34:45,914 --> 00:34:48,124
- What are you?
- Detective Sergeant Conklin,

414
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:49,959
Homicide, New York.

415
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,296
So, how'd you get that blood?

416
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:58,297
The girls wanna know if you're the guy
that lost Sato at the airport.

417
00:34:58,385 --> 00:35:01,304
Just off the plane,
you make the evening news.

418
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:04,098
Very impressive.

419
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,517
Americans who are less than perfect,
it's very amusing to them.

420
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:11,518
Could I talk to you for a minute, please?

421
00:35:11,982 --> 00:35:14,984
You still didn't tell me
how you got the blood.

422
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:17,570
The girl who found the body
was just a little bit upset.

423
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:19,030
So I put my arms around her.

424
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:20,156
- Wouldn't you?
- Yeah.

425
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:21,866
- You got a Cigarette?
- Sure.

426
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:25,995
- Where you from? You from Boston?
- Chicago.

427
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,414
Where'd you learn
how to speak Japanese?

428
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:30,333
Chicago.

429
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:35,004
So, did you know the victim?

430
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:38,132
A couple guys came in here for a drink
and this is how it turned out.

431
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:41,260
How about the killer?
Did you see the killer leave?

432
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:44,055
Yeah, sure, and he wrote
his name and address down

433
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:47,433
on the back of my dress
and he asked me to give it to you.

434
00:35:47,434 --> 00:35:48,518
Anything else?

435
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:51,354
What are you busting my ass for?

436
00:35:51,355 --> 00:35:53,481
'Cause you could
get me killed, Detective.

437
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:57,193
You see, there's a war going on here
and they don't take prisoners.

438
00:35:57,194 --> 00:35:58,861
What are you talking about?

439
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:02,365
Between Sato and an old-time boss,
a guy named Sugai.

440
00:36:02,366 --> 00:36:04,492
Who knows about this?

441
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:06,536
- Counting you and me?
- Yeah.

442
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:11,537
Eleven million.

443
00:36:15,546 --> 00:36:18,589
Did that woman tell you anything,
Detective Conklin?

444
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,383
Why the hell
would she tell me anything?

445
00:36:20,384 --> 00:36:22,635
I'm an observer.

446
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:27,636
You tell Ohashi I'll report to him
when he's ready to report to me.

447
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,726
I'm a police officer
just like you, Detective.

448
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:32,645
Bullshit. You're a suit.

449
00:36:32,646 --> 00:36:36,399
Go tell Ohashi one good hand job
deserves another.

450
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,900
I don't understand.

451
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:40,069
Mas...

452
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:45,070
Hey, Charlie, get your map out, will you,
babe? Find the directions to the hotel.

453
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,244
- Don't you want a ride?
- We'll walk.

454
00:36:48,245 --> 00:36:50,955
What I want is a complete file
on Sato, all right?

455
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:52,999
A full report
on what the hell happened here tonight

456
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and all other relevant information to
this case translated by 0900 tomorrow.

457
00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:01,174
- You got that, Matsumoto?
- Very well.

458
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:03,634
Well, thank you.

459
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,928
Let's go, Charlie. Come on.

460
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:08,139
You'll have a long walk home.

461
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:13,140
Fine. If I get lost, we'll call a cop.

462
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:13,978
What?

463
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:28,451
I mean, I like the guy.
I mean, I don't know why they wouldn't

464
00:37:28,452 --> 00:37:30,953
fill us in on a simple gang war,
but I like the guy.

465
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:32,121
So, what's happening, baby?

466
00:37:32,122 --> 00:37:34,207
Tell me in four blocks,
we're walking 20 minutes here.

467
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,959
Now, wait a second,
Mr. We'll-Walk-Home-To-The-Hotel.

468
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,212
What do I look like?
I work at the fucking UN?

469
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:42,006
You got no idea
where the goddamn hotel is.

470
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:44,091
Mr. Conklin, is this an appropriate time
to ask you

471
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:47,762
what's going down with Oliver?

472
00:37:47,763 --> 00:37:52,183
Yeah, some suits back home
think I cut a deal with Sato.

473
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:53,684
They're full of shit.

474
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:55,478
Hey, they're gonna believe
what they wanna believe.

475
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,897
Well, don't worry about it.
I'll back you up.

476
00:37:57,898 --> 00:38:02,898
What the hell's going on here?

477
00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:35,851
What? What?

478
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:40,852
What's your problem?

479
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:55,162
I don't know, Nicky.

480
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:56,872
Something tells me
we should cut our losses

481
00:38:56,873 --> 00:39:00,042
and let the locals handle it around here.

482
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:05,043
I can't go back without him, Charlie.

483
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:10,011
Sato Koji.

484
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:15,012
He started young and rose quickly,
from street enforcer to minor boss.

485
00:39:15,726 --> 00:39:20,726
He controlled some of the docks
and some construction in Hawaii.

486
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:25,109
Okay. Victim last night
was one of Sayto's guys, right?

487
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,444
- Right.
- Sato's.

488
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:27,611
Sato, right.

489
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:32,612
And six hours earlier, he's suspected
of putting a hit on this guy...

490
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:37,663
Okada Genkuro, damascene maker.
An artist.

491
00:39:37,664 --> 00:39:38,748
He's an engraver.

492
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:41,417
Forty-eight hours later,
he's snapping caps at Scalari's.

493
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:44,211
Masa, Who's the monkey here
with Sayto?

494
00:39:44,212 --> 00:39:45,421
Sato.

495
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:47,757
Sato, Sayto.

496
00:39:47,758 --> 00:39:50,885
Sugai Kunio, top oyabun.

497
00:39:50,886 --> 00:39:52,762
Like your mafia bosses.

498
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:56,974
Construction, gambling, extortion.

499
00:39:56,975 --> 00:39:58,893
What's Sugai doing with Sayto?

500
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:01,354
- I don't know.
- I don't believe...

501
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:03,147
Wait, wait. Mas, wait one second.

502
00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:06,400
Look, even I know that Sayto
used to be the lieutenant for Sugai.

503
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:08,944
Now there's a war going on
between the two of them.

504
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:11,530
I mean, they're knocking each other off
left and right.

505
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:16,531
Oh, these goddamn suits, man.

506
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:20,414
Mas, what's with the SWATs out here?

507
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:22,041
Exercise.

508
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:23,626
Exercise?

509
00:40:23,627 --> 00:40:25,711
- Training, perhaps.
- Come on, Mas.

510
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:27,380
You're gonna have
to start cutting us in here.

511
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:28,881
The thing is, Charlie, I can't figure out

512
00:40:28,882 --> 00:40:31,092
what's in that box at Scalari's,
you know?

513
00:40:31,093 --> 00:40:34,178
- This guy Sugai into drugs?
- No drugs.

514
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:38,349
- Steel. Liquor.
- Nicky.

515
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:43,350
Horses. He owns part of Club Miyako.

516
00:40:48,151 --> 00:40:50,444
- Matsumoto.
- Yes.

517
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:52,488
What's going on outside?

518
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:55,324
They have a tip
about Sato's last hide-out.

519
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:56,909
- Oh, they have a tip.
- They got a tip.

520
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:59,829
- It's only a tip.
- It's only a tip, Nick.

521
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,331
I promise I will keep you informed,
okay?

522
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:03,582
- You promise?
- Yes.

523
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,626
- That's good enough.
- All right.

524
00:41:05,627 --> 00:41:09,213
You got that file on Sato's guy...

525
00:41:09,214 --> 00:41:11,382
- Sekimitsu? Yes, sir.
- Sekimitsu. Yes.

526
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:16,383
Yeah. Good.

527
00:41:16,596 --> 00:41:18,264
Police observers!

528
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:21,767
It's okay! It's okay!

529
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:23,477
Please. I need authorization.

530
00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:26,063
No. It's only a tip, Mas.
It's only a tip. Come on.

531
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:27,231
Let's go! Let's all tip!

532
00:41:27,232 --> 00:41:32,232
Training exercise.

533
00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:17,986
- Observers!
- You got it.

534
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:43,011
- Observers!
- Okay, okay.

535
00:42:52,692 --> 00:42:57,692
Isn't that the guy from the airport?

536
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:08,745
- That's one of the guys, right?
- Yeah, it's him.

537
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:19,965
Easy, Nicky.

538
00:43:23,765 --> 00:43:28,602
Hi, sweetheart.

539
00:43:28,603 --> 00:43:31,564
You remember me, don't you?

540
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:36,565
So where's your boss?

541
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:44,618
Nicky, what are you doing?

542
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:46,704
- I only wanna talk to the man...
- What are you doing?

543
00:43:46,705 --> 00:43:48,163
For five minutes. That's all I wanna do.

544
00:43:48,164 --> 00:43:51,500
It's not proper. It's not proper.
You're a foreigner.

545
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:53,627
This isn't New York.
We have rules here.

546
00:43:53,628 --> 00:43:55,421
You have rules here, huh?
Hey, look, pal,

547
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:58,465
I've seen Sato's work, okay?
He ain't following your program.

548
00:43:58,466 --> 00:44:03,466
- You must learn patience.
- Oh, fuck patience.

549
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:18,068
He was here.

550
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:23,069
I know it.

551
00:44:29,706 --> 00:44:32,041
Gentlemen, we have to go.

552
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:35,628
We're observing, Mas. Just observing.

553
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:40,629
Can I take a quick look?

554
00:45:36,564 --> 00:45:37,108
Charlie.

555
00:45:46,616 --> 00:45:48,992
- You get something?
- Yeah, I got something.

556
00:45:48,993 --> 00:45:51,412
We gotta share it with Mas.
He's in deep shit with his boss.

557
00:45:51,413 --> 00:45:51,913
<i>Okay-</i>

558
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:13,976
You don't want to eat that shit, do you?

559
00:46:13,977 --> 00:46:18,977
- Put it there.
- Hand me that stick.

560
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:22,985
Son of a bitch.

561
00:46:22,986 --> 00:46:24,987
Always said you're the best.

562
00:46:24,988 --> 00:46:29,988
- I owe you lunch, babe.
- Okay, babe.

563
00:47:00,023 --> 00:47:04,693
Where's Mas?

564
00:47:04,694 --> 00:47:06,528
Hey! Mas!

565
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:09,364
We got good news for you, babe.

566
00:47:09,365 --> 00:47:14,365
What the fuck's his problem?

567
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:23,921
I will have no more to do with you.

568
00:47:23,922 --> 00:47:27,216
Please get out.

569
00:47:27,217 --> 00:47:29,885
Look, what are you talking about?
I know you took a little heat

570
00:47:29,886 --> 00:47:31,053
for taking us on the raid...

571
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:32,429
Superintendent Ohashi is
waiting for you.

572
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,973
We understand. We're gonna
square you with Ohashi, Mas.

573
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:37,226
Let us explain what happened.

574
00:47:37,227 --> 00:47:41,396
You've dishonored me
and our department.

575
00:47:41,397 --> 00:47:46,397
You are a thief.

576
00:47:48,404 --> 00:47:53,404
I saw you take the money.

577
00:47:54,661 --> 00:47:57,246
You saw me take the money, huh?

578
00:47:57,247 --> 00:48:00,916
You know what it's like trying
to get something done around here.

579
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:03,168
I've informed Ohashi of your crime.

580
00:48:03,169 --> 00:48:05,879
He has spoken to your Captain
in New York.

581
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,923
We know the kind of man you are.

582
00:48:07,924 --> 00:48:11,593
You dumb fuck! You don't know
one thing about me, all right? Listen!

583
00:48:11,594 --> 00:48:13,846
It's you and your self-righteous
bullshit, man,

584
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:15,389
it's gonna cost me my goddamn job.

585
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:20,390
Hey! Hey! I'm talking to you!

586
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:30,233
If you pull it, you better use it.

587
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:34,449
All right. Watch this, okay?

588
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:39,450
I only want to do this once.

589
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:42,583
All right. Look at this. Come here. Look.

590
00:48:42,584 --> 00:48:45,210
See how the impression part
leaves the ashes?

591
00:48:45,211 --> 00:48:47,045
It's because there wasn't
enough pressure.

592
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:48,171
It should be higher.

593
00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:50,924
Now, this is good.
This is as good as it comes,

594
00:48:50,925 --> 00:48:52,217
but this ain't money.

595
00:48:52,218 --> 00:48:53,844
I don't know about the box at the club.

596
00:48:53,845 --> 00:48:56,263
Could've been samples,
Could've been plates,

597
00:48:56,264 --> 00:48:58,640
but you guys got
a counterfeiting war going on.

598
00:48:58,641 --> 00:49:03,228
And you, pal, should talk to your partner
before you go to the suits, okay?

599
00:49:03,229 --> 00:49:06,148
So, fuck you very much.

600
00:49:06,149 --> 00:49:11,149
We were gonna cut you
in on the deal, Mas.

601
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:42,392
Don't say you never had a good time.

602
00:49:42,393 --> 00:49:44,937
Don't say you never had a good time
with Charlie Vincent.

603
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:49,938
All right! Kanpai, guys!

604
00:49:51,027 --> 00:49:52,486
Where's that American girl?

605
00:49:52,487 --> 00:49:54,029
You know, the American girl
that was here,

606
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:56,531
you know, the one that was here.
Is she around tonight? You know, the...

607
00:49:56,532 --> 00:49:58,951
Mas!

608
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:00,869
Come here, baby.

609
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:05,870
Join us! Come on!

610
00:50:09,796 --> 00:50:13,924
Oh, baby, what is it?
It's still moving in my mouth.

611
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:15,008
Good evening.

612
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:16,885
Matsumoto the Mountie, huh?

613
00:50:16,886 --> 00:50:18,720
I haven't taken the silvenNare,
babe, all right?

614
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:20,097
So why don't you just go take a hike.

615
00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:24,393
Come on, Nicky, what are you doing?
Mas, sit down. Join us.

616
00:50:24,394 --> 00:50:27,187
Superintendent Ohashi
would like to see you in the morning.

617
00:50:27,188 --> 00:50:29,064
Superintendent Ohashi
would like to see me.

618
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:32,234
Give me a break.

619
00:50:32,235 --> 00:50:35,487
Mas, can you smoke
a little peace pipe here, guys?

620
00:50:35,488 --> 00:50:37,698
Everybody was doing
the right thing, right?

621
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:41,243
We're all partners now.
Mas, please join us.

622
00:50:41,244 --> 00:50:44,413
Relax and have a good time.
Please, sit down.

623
00:50:44,414 --> 00:50:46,623
Come on, Mas.

624
00:50:46,624 --> 00:50:50,043
Thank you.

625
00:50:50,044 --> 00:50:52,379
Masahiro Matsumoto,
a famous detective!

626
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:57,380
Famous detective!

627
00:50:57,927 --> 00:51:02,347
Conklin, I did my duty.

628
00:51:02,348 --> 00:51:03,932
These are the men I work for.

629
00:51:03,933 --> 00:51:05,350
Like I told you, pal,

630
00:51:05,351 --> 00:51:08,437
you talk to your partners first
before you go to the suits.

631
00:51:08,438 --> 00:51:09,980
- Okay?
- Come on, Nicky.

632
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:13,358
Perhaps you should think
less of yourself and more of your group.

633
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:16,194
Try to work like a Japanese.

634
00:51:16,195 --> 00:51:20,615
Listen. I grew up with your soldiers.
You were wise then.

635
00:51:20,616 --> 00:51:24,953
Now, music and movies
are all America is good for!

636
00:51:24,954 --> 00:51:28,123
Right? We make the machines.

637
00:51:28,124 --> 00:51:31,918
We built the future. We won the peace.

638
00:51:31,919 --> 00:51:33,795
And if there was one of you guys

639
00:51:33,796 --> 00:51:36,590
who had an original idea,
you'd be so tight

640
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:38,467
you couldn't even pull it out of your ass!

641
00:51:38,468 --> 00:51:40,052
What the hell's going on here?
What are you guys?

642
00:51:40,053 --> 00:51:42,471
You got to argue all the time?

643
00:51:42,472 --> 00:51:44,306
- See you later.
- Come on, Nicky.

644
00:51:44,307 --> 00:51:47,142
What is this?
A conspiracy to fuck up my evening?

645
00:51:47,143 --> 00:51:50,270
What the hell's the problem here?

646
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:51,897
Mas, what are you doing?

647
00:51:51,898 --> 00:51:53,982
This is good-time time, Mas. Okay?

648
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,485
You know, <i>kanpai</i> time?

649
00:51:56,486 --> 00:51:58,862
- Up and down, huh?
- Up and down! In and out!

650
00:51:58,863 --> 00:52:03,863
<i>Okay, kanpai.</i>

651
00:52:19,092 --> 00:52:22,719
- Joyce.
- Can I talk to you, please?

652
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,012
Jesus.

653
00:52:24,013 --> 00:52:25,639
All right, Chicago, look,
I need some help, all right?

654
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,475
My tit's in the ringer.
I don't speak the goddamn language.

655
00:52:28,476 --> 00:52:33,188
So give me a couple minutes.

656
00:52:33,189 --> 00:52:34,564
You see that woman down there?

657
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:36,817
You give her $50
and you go where she takes you.

658
00:52:36,818 --> 00:52:41,818
Then I'll find you.

659
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:54,126
Hey, babe!

660
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:55,377
Can we get a little mercy here?

661
00:52:55,378 --> 00:52:58,547
Some people are trying to eat.
Thank you very much.

662
00:52:58,548 --> 00:53:00,382
You like this stuff, huh, Mas?

663
00:53:00,383 --> 00:53:02,509
- Yes.
- Yes?

664
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,178
<i>- That's Amore.
- That's Amore!</i>

665
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:07,430
I was a teenager when it was new.

666
00:53:07,431 --> 00:53:10,934
And I was a teenager
when it was old, Mas.

667
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:13,019
If you're gonna hang around
with the NYPD, Mas,

668
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,606
- there's one thing you gotta do for me.
- What?

669
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:20,110
You're gonna have to lose
the Kmart tie, babe. It's a fire hazard.

670
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:24,364
I'm gonna give you a little gift,
straight from the Big Apple.

671
00:53:24,365 --> 00:53:29,365
From Charlie Vincent to you.

672
00:53:30,246 --> 00:53:34,249
- Thanks.
- It's my honor.

673
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,460
I like you.

674
00:53:37,461 --> 00:53:38,753
Top-drawer, yes!

675
00:53:38,754 --> 00:53:42,716
Top-drawer, yes. Top-drawer, no?

676
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:44,176
Hey, meatball! What are you doing?

677
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:48,805
If you can't hit the note,
throw your hat on it, babe.

678
00:53:48,806 --> 00:53:51,683
- You could do better?
- I cannot tell a lie.

679
00:53:51,684 --> 00:53:53,435
Yes, I could do better.

680
00:53:53,436 --> 00:53:55,353
Then put it up or shut it up.

681
00:53:55,354 --> 00:54:00,354
For you, from me.

682
00:54:04,947 --> 00:54:06,198
Thank you.

683
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:11,199
Don't quit your day job.

684
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:17,959
That quick?

685
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:22,505
What you talkin' 'bout?

686
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:26,134
Hey!

687
00:54:26,135 --> 00:54:28,345
<i>Hey, What'd I Say,</i> babe!

688
00:54:28,346 --> 00:54:33,346
Look at me, Mas.

689
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:49,157
- Ray Charles!
- Yes!

690
00:54:49,158 --> 00:54:53,286
You and me!

691
00:54:53,287 --> 00:54:56,498
Detective, wait!

692
00:54:56,499 --> 00:55:01,499
Masahiro Matsumoto,
ladies and gentlemen!

693
00:55:02,463 --> 00:55:07,463
You and me, baby.

694
00:55:26,696 --> 00:55:29,030
Masahiro Matsumoto,
ladies and gentlemen!

695
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:31,366
Osaka Prefectural Police Department!

696
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:33,702
If you're looking for Sato,

697
00:55:33,703 --> 00:55:35,412
I can't help you.

698
00:55:35,413 --> 00:55:39,207
He hasn't been here in over a year.

699
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:41,001
Who would he do regularly?

700
00:55:41,002 --> 00:55:43,295
And what makes you think
I pay attention?

701
00:55:43,296 --> 00:55:48,296
Honey, I think you'd recognize if one
of your customers had a different tie on.

702
00:55:52,179 --> 00:55:54,931
He had a different girl every time

703
00:55:54,932 --> 00:55:57,058
and I don't know
who he's doing regularly.

704
00:55:57,059 --> 00:55:59,352
- If that's where you're heading.
- Is that Sugai,

705
00:55:59,353 --> 00:56:01,229
- the one going at it with Sato?
- Right.

706
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,773
And the girl with sequins
had blood on her hands.

707
00:56:03,774 --> 00:56:08,236
- You did your homework.
- All right. How do I get to him?

708
00:56:08,237 --> 00:56:10,280
Look,

709
00:56:10,281 --> 00:56:13,450
I've been living in this country
for seven years

710
00:56:13,451 --> 00:56:15,535
and I still can't read the headlines.

711
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:17,746
Yes means no, maybe means never.

712
00:56:17,747 --> 00:56:20,415
You didn't answer my question.
How do I get to him?

713
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:23,543
Let the police handle it.

714
00:56:23,544 --> 00:56:25,754
<i>- No</i> one's gonna help <i>a gaijin.
- Gaijin?</i>

715
00:56:25,755 --> 00:56:28,423
Yeah, a stranger,
a barbarian, a foreigner.

716
00:56:28,424 --> 00:56:30,342
Me and you.

717
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:30,955
More you.

718
00:56:40,478 --> 00:56:42,896
- Gotta go.
- Chicago, wait. Hold on.

719
00:56:42,897 --> 00:56:46,107
You know, they got lights out there,
Wrigley Field now, you know?

720
00:56:46,108 --> 00:56:47,776
Yeah. Mom told me.

721
00:56:47,777 --> 00:56:48,985
Did she?

722
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:51,154
She say it's not stupid to be scared?

723
00:56:51,155 --> 00:56:53,531
But you just can't stand still,

724
00:56:53,532 --> 00:56:58,203
and sometimes
you got to choose a side.

725
00:56:58,204 --> 00:56:59,913
I did.

726
00:56:59,914 --> 00:57:04,914
I'm on my side.

727
00:57:32,238 --> 00:57:35,365
- All right, drinks cost $125.
- 125 bucks.

728
00:57:35,366 --> 00:57:38,743
- How about the fish?
- 200 bucks.

729
00:57:38,744 --> 00:57:41,287
200 bucks! Holy shit!

730
00:57:41,288 --> 00:57:43,998
How much do you think
it'd cost if it was cooked?

731
00:57:43,999 --> 00:57:45,542
- Did you pay for it?
- No.

732
00:57:45,543 --> 00:57:48,086
Assistant Inspector
Masahiro Matsumoto

733
00:57:48,087 --> 00:57:51,881
signed it over to the
Osaka Prefectural Police Department.

734
00:57:51,882 --> 00:57:53,550
Best thing they've done for us
since we've been here.

735
00:57:53,551 --> 00:57:54,968
We was owed.

736
00:57:54,969 --> 00:57:56,636
You like this guy, huh?

737
00:57:56,637 --> 00:57:58,012
- Mas?
- Yeah.

738
00:57:58,013 --> 00:57:59,389
He's okay.

739
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:04,018
What the hell's this?

740
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:08,189
Come on, baby.

741
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:13,190
I don't know, Charlie.
I can't figure this place out.

742
00:58:13,863 --> 00:58:17,699
Come out, babe. You want to play?
You and me. Come on.

743
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,035
Come on. Right here.
Come on. Come on.

744
00:58:21,036 --> 00:58:23,204
That's it. That's it. Come on. Right here.

745
00:58:23,205 --> 00:58:24,581
Hey! Fuck!

746
00:58:24,582 --> 00:58:26,499
- Good, Charlie.
- Fuck me.

747
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,421
- Good move, babe.
- Hey! Hey!

748
00:58:31,422 --> 00:58:33,882
- Real good, Charlie.
- Okay, good. Come on.

749
00:58:33,883 --> 00:58:36,801
Bring it back. We'll go again.

750
00:58:36,802 --> 00:58:39,888
You, bring it back.

751
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:42,432
- Did you see that?
- Don't get fucking personal, all right?

752
00:58:42,433 --> 00:58:44,058
- Hey, fuck you!
- Hey!

753
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:45,852
- Hey, Charlie.
- Fuck!

754
00:58:45,853 --> 00:58:48,646
Hey, Charlie, come on,
it's only a goddamn coat!

755
00:58:48,647 --> 00:58:50,565
He's got my fucking passport!

756
00:58:50,566 --> 00:58:55,028
- Come here, you little fuck! Come here!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

757
00:58:55,029 --> 00:59:00,029
Come here, you fuck.
Come here! Come here!

758
00:59:00,576 --> 00:59:05,413
Hey, Charlie! Charlie!

759
00:59:05,414 --> 00:59:05,958
Charlie!

760
00:59:19,136 --> 00:59:24,136
You little shit!

761
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:39,697
Hey, Charlie!

762
00:59:39,698 --> 00:59:43,243
Come here! Come here!

763
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:43,744
Fuck!

764
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:51,584
Oh!

765
00:59:51,585 --> 00:59:55,838
Oh, you little shit!

766
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,091
Stay there, you little shit! Right there!

767
00:59:58,092 --> 01:00:00,134
Stay right there!

768
01:00:00,135 --> 01:00:03,221
Oh, you little shit!

769
01:00:03,222 --> 01:00:08,222
Oh, oh, you fuck. All right.

770
01:00:11,981 --> 01:00:16,981
Come on, babe! Let's go!

771
01:00:26,036 --> 01:00:26,536
Shit!

772
01:00:36,005 --> 01:00:39,465
Come on! Come on! Come on!

773
01:00:39,466 --> 01:00:41,843
Come on.

774
01:00:41,844 --> 01:00:44,762
Come on! Who's first?

775
01:00:44,763 --> 01:00:48,391
Come on!

776
01:00:48,392 --> 01:00:51,144
Charlie!

777
01:00:51,145 --> 01:00:56,145
Get out of there, Charlie!

778
01:00:59,445 --> 01:01:03,323
Get out of there! Get away!

779
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:03,868
Charlie!

780
01:01:08,954 --> 01:01:13,954
Oh, Jesus Christ!

781
01:01:15,753 --> 01:01:16,365
You fuck!

782
01:01:30,267 --> 01:01:31,809
Charlie!

783
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:36,810
Get out of there!

784
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:39,111
Charlie!

785
01:02:37,668 --> 01:02:42,668
You better come with me. Come on.

786
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:14,199
He should have known better. He...

787
01:03:14,538 --> 01:03:19,538
He was raised in the city and...

788
01:03:20,169 --> 01:03:23,337
See, my job...

789
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:28,338
You kind of see things
the way they really are.

790
01:03:28,761 --> 01:03:33,761
You don't have to see a person
whole one minute and...

791
01:03:40,689 --> 01:03:45,689
He was 28 years old.

792
01:04:44,711 --> 01:04:49,711
May I speak to Nick-san alone?

793
01:04:51,426 --> 01:04:51,926
Sure.

794
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:08,730
I'm very sorry for your loss.

795
01:05:09,611 --> 01:05:13,531
I thought maybe you should know.

796
01:05:13,532 --> 01:05:18,452
I made all arrangements for Charlie.

797
01:05:18,453 --> 01:05:20,913
Thank you.

798
01:05:20,914 --> 01:05:25,042
I feel... I feel that

799
01:05:25,043 --> 01:05:28,796
if I had been with you,

800
01:05:28,797 --> 01:05:32,800
Charlie-san would...

801
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:37,138
It would not have happened.

802
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:42,139
I'm very sorry.

803
01:05:45,814 --> 01:05:50,443
Charlie's things...

804
01:05:50,444 --> 01:05:53,696
We have a tradition.

805
01:05:53,697 --> 01:05:58,534
When someone close to us dies,

806
01:05:58,535 --> 01:06:03,535
we keep something personal of his.

807
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:08,586
Can we do this another time?

808
01:06:08,587 --> 01:06:13,587
Please, Nick-san.

809
01:06:36,406 --> 01:06:41,406
This is for you.

810
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:05,681
I can take anything I want?

811
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:06,631
Anything.

812
01:07:24,413 --> 01:07:29,083
I wanna go back
to Sato's hide-out, okay?

813
01:07:29,084 --> 01:07:34,084
Just you and me.

814
01:07:46,935 --> 01:07:50,563
There's always something, Mas.

815
01:07:50,564 --> 01:07:55,564
Always something.

816
01:08:01,783 --> 01:08:02,283
Yeah.

817
01:08:06,413 --> 01:08:11,413
He had himself a real nice party.

818
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:44,529
You feel safe?

819
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:48,120
Well, feel safe!

820
01:08:48,121 --> 01:08:49,455
I'm here!

821
01:08:49,456 --> 01:08:54,456
Let's get this thing...

822
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:17,020
Nick-san, there's nothing here.

823
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:24,820
We should go.

824
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:50,350
Masa.

825
01:09:54,312 --> 01:09:54,856
Sequins.

826
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:09,906
Okay, here we go.

827
01:10:26,928 --> 01:10:31,928
How can you be so sure?
It could be any girl's dress.

828
01:10:32,475 --> 01:10:37,313
Sometimes you gotta forget your head
and grab your balls.

829
01:10:37,314 --> 01:10:39,440
Balls?

830
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:41,108
- Balls.
- Balls.

831
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:46,109
Come on, hot dog.
You're going to lose her. Come on.

832
01:11:03,965 --> 01:11:08,965
All right. Let's keep in touch.

833
01:11:46,508 --> 01:11:49,176
- All right. Masa, Masa, come in.
- Rogen

834
01:11:49,177 --> 01:11:51,470
I got her.
She's on the other side of the market.

835
01:11:51,471 --> 01:11:56,471
I want you to bring the wheels around.

836
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:15,699
- Good?
- Oh, yeah. This is great. Yeah.

837
01:12:15,787 --> 01:12:17,496
Pepper?

838
01:12:17,497 --> 01:12:22,497
Oh, yeah. Thanks, yeah.

839
01:12:30,885 --> 01:12:33,220
Oh, yeah?

840
01:12:33,221 --> 01:12:33,833
Oh, yeah?

841
01:12:40,353 --> 01:12:40,853
Yeah.

842
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:51,359
Big shot from New York, huh?

843
01:12:55,952 --> 01:13:00,039
<i>- Nick-san.
- Yeah?</i>

844
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,082
There's something...

845
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,417
Maybe I should not ask.

846
01:13:03,418 --> 01:13:05,502
What? What? You can ask me
anything you want, Masa.

847
01:13:05,503 --> 01:13:08,547
What do you wanna know?

848
01:13:08,548 --> 01:13:13,548
These disturbing things
I hear about you in New York.

849
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:21,769
A couple of guys
I used to work with in the department

850
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,772
took some money
from some drug dealers.

851
01:13:24,773 --> 01:13:29,109
It's no big deal.

852
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:32,946
They stole?

853
01:13:32,947 --> 01:13:37,947
They... They liberated funds.

854
01:13:38,787 --> 01:13:43,787
Theft is theft. There is no gray area.

855
01:13:43,792 --> 01:13:48,792
Hey, Masa,
New York is one big gray area, okay?

856
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,760
Did you take money?

857
01:14:04,979 --> 01:14:09,979
Yeah, I took money.

858
01:14:10,235 --> 01:14:14,988
I'm not proud of it, okay? You know, I...

859
01:14:14,989 --> 01:14:19,989
I had a divorce, I got kids, bills...

860
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:32,506
Did Charlie-san know?

861
01:14:32,507 --> 01:14:36,260
No.

862
01:14:36,261 --> 01:14:41,181
He was a policeman, Nick.

863
01:14:41,182 --> 01:14:45,853
If you steal,

864
01:14:45,854 --> 01:14:50,854
you disgrace him

865
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:56,443
and yourself and me.

866
01:15:06,499 --> 01:15:06,999
Thanks.

867
01:16:01,513 --> 01:16:04,389
Masa, rise and shine, babe.

868
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:07,267
We got action.

869
01:16:07,268 --> 01:16:12,268
She just went into the store over there.

870
01:16:12,273 --> 01:16:17,273
There she goes.

871
01:16:17,445 --> 01:16:22,445
Just a little morning walk.

872
01:18:06,095 --> 01:18:08,889
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

873
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:12,517
She's getting a cab. Mas, grab a taxi.

874
01:18:12,518 --> 01:18:13,018
Taxi!

875
01:18:19,442 --> 01:18:21,777
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

876
01:18:21,778 --> 01:18:24,738
That's the guy that set up Charlie.

877
01:18:24,739 --> 01:18:29,739
That's the switch.

878
01:18:29,952 --> 01:18:34,952
- Let's go.
- Okay.

879
01:21:19,038 --> 01:21:21,748
You each have one plate.

880
01:21:21,749 --> 01:21:26,749
One for the front of the bill
and one for the back.

881
01:21:31,092 --> 01:21:36,092
Sato, have you
brought the plate with you?

882
01:21:37,014 --> 01:21:38,390
It is my only insurance.

883
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:43,270
If I had brought the plate,
I would be a dead man.

884
01:21:43,271 --> 01:21:48,271
Better get your cops.

885
01:21:51,237 --> 01:21:56,237
I sent one of the plates to America...

886
01:21:56,951 --> 01:22:01,288
to prove the quality
of my engraver's work.

887
01:22:01,289 --> 01:22:03,623
This traitor took it
from my representatives

888
01:22:03,624 --> 01:22:06,126
and then murdered them.

889
01:22:06,127 --> 01:22:08,003
Look at him!

890
01:22:08,004 --> 01:22:13,004
He knows nothing of loyalty and respect.

891
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:19,180
My men respect me, Sugai-san.

892
01:22:19,181 --> 01:22:24,181
I want my own territory.

893
01:22:28,608 --> 01:22:33,608
Your methods are crude
and disgraceful.

894
01:22:34,989 --> 01:22:38,325
You liked my methods well enough

895
01:22:38,326 --> 01:22:41,661
when they served you.

896
01:22:41,662 --> 01:22:46,166
You must return the plate,
then we can discuss your future.

897
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:51,167
<i>I want</i> to <i>be an Oyabun...</i>

898
01:22:51,339 --> 01:22:56,301
of equal standing to others...

899
01:22:56,302 --> 01:22:59,721
and I want my own territory

900
01:22:59,722 --> 01:23:04,722
far away from you.

901
01:23:09,857 --> 01:23:14,361
Not one <i>Oyabun</i> in all Japan
would listen to such absurd demands.

902
01:23:14,362 --> 01:23:17,030
How old are you, Sato?

903
01:23:17,031 --> 01:23:20,700
Do you want to live a little longer?

904
01:23:20,701 --> 01:23:25,701
Not as long as you, old man!

905
01:24:22,596 --> 01:24:23,140
Hold it!

906
01:25:17,568 --> 01:25:20,236
Here I am, Nick!

907
01:25:20,237 --> 01:25:21,821
Here!

908
01:25:21,822 --> 01:25:26,822
Almost as near
as when you let Charlie die, huh?

909
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:37,647
He's getting away!

910
01:26:37,648 --> 01:26:42,648
He's getting away!

911
01:26:50,202 --> 01:26:53,663
- Jesus!
- I told you, no guns.

912
01:26:53,664 --> 01:26:55,832
I thought we were working together,
god damn it!

913
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:57,750
He went right past you!

914
01:26:57,751 --> 01:27:00,420
Right past you, he went! Jesus Christ!

915
01:27:00,421 --> 01:27:05,421
Look! The guy's getting away!

916
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:08,595
Wait. What's going on?

917
01:27:08,596 --> 01:27:11,055
We are going to put you on a plane.

918
01:27:11,056 --> 01:27:16,056
Should you return, you'll be arrested.

919
01:28:09,907 --> 01:28:12,450
<i>On behalf of Northwest Airlines,</i>

920
01:28:12,451 --> 01:28:14,744
<i>I would like to welcome you on board.</i>

921
01:28:14,745 --> 01:28:19,745
<i>We anticipate an on time departure
for this flight.</i>

922
01:29:53,635 --> 01:29:58,635
Masahiro Matsumoto?

923
01:30:00,309 --> 01:30:05,309
Thank you.

924
01:30:07,691 --> 01:30:10,443
Hey, Masa.

925
01:30:10,444 --> 01:30:11,986
Nick-san.

926
01:30:11,987 --> 01:30:14,947
Excuse me. Shoes.

927
01:30:14,948 --> 01:30:18,076
- Shoes.
- Oh.

928
01:30:18,077 --> 01:30:21,871
It's not possible. You are gone.

929
01:30:21,872 --> 01:30:25,166
You know me. I don't go quietly, Masa.

930
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:28,795
Thanks.

931
01:30:28,796 --> 01:30:31,964
I need your help.

932
01:30:31,965 --> 01:30:34,842
I'm sorry, but you should not have come.

933
01:30:34,843 --> 01:30:39,843
You have done enough to him.

934
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:09,043
Please pardon my son.

935
01:31:09,044 --> 01:31:10,336
He came to comfort me,

936
01:31:10,337 --> 01:31:13,589
but all he does
is show his disappointment.

937
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:17,176
You never even told me
you had a son, Mas.

938
01:31:17,177 --> 01:31:22,177
It doesn't matter.

939
01:31:22,349 --> 01:31:25,101
I have been suspended, Nick-san.

940
01:31:25,102 --> 01:31:30,102
I am no longer an assistant inspector.

941
01:31:32,693 --> 01:31:34,819
Oh...

942
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:38,781
Jesus Christ.

943
01:31:38,782 --> 01:31:41,033
- I'm sorry, man. I...
- Nol

944
01:31:41,034 --> 01:31:44,620
I knew what I was doing.

945
01:31:44,621 --> 01:31:46,956
Well, it's not over yet.

946
01:31:46,957 --> 01:31:50,960
We can get him, Mas, you and me.

947
01:31:50,961 --> 01:31:53,045
I cannot help you.

948
01:31:53,046 --> 01:31:55,298
- Nick-san, look at me.
- We can fix it, Mas.

949
01:31:55,299 --> 01:31:57,884
You cannot fix everything.

950
01:31:57,885 --> 01:32:01,596
I am not like you.

951
01:32:01,597 --> 01:32:04,098
For a moment, I thought I could be.

952
01:32:04,099 --> 01:32:07,059
You can, all right.
You didn't do anything wrong, okay?

953
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:09,562
- We kicked ass.
- It was for nothing.

954
01:32:09,563 --> 01:32:12,231
- Oh, come on, Masa. Come...
- Nick-san.

955
01:32:12,232 --> 01:32:16,444
I belong to a group.

956
01:32:16,445 --> 01:32:20,031
They will not have me anymore.

957
01:32:20,032 --> 01:32:25,032
You're digging a hole for yourself, Mas.

958
01:32:25,579 --> 01:32:28,873
Sometimes you got to go for it.

959
01:32:28,874 --> 01:32:32,752
Get out.

960
01:32:32,753 --> 01:32:33,253
Please.

961
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:55,771
Yeah. Joyce. I want to speak to...
Joyce. Joyce-san. Yeah.

962
01:33:07,913 --> 01:33:12,333
Where's Sugai, Joyce?

963
01:33:12,334 --> 01:33:14,377
Can I find him in the bar?

964
01:33:14,378 --> 01:33:17,880
Here's your food. Here's some cash.

965
01:33:17,881 --> 01:33:22,881
What about Sugai?

966
01:33:32,688 --> 01:33:35,106
You wanna find Sugai,

967
01:33:35,107 --> 01:33:37,692
this is where you'll find him.

968
01:33:37,693 --> 01:33:42,693
He loves golf.
He's here three times a week.

969
01:33:42,864 --> 01:33:45,700
You always try and get rid of me,

970
01:33:45,701 --> 01:33:48,160
you know, yet you're...

971
01:33:48,161 --> 01:33:50,663
You're always there.

972
01:33:50,664 --> 01:33:55,251
I think sometime we're going to have
to try to figure that one out.

973
01:33:55,252 --> 01:34:00,252
You said you wouldn't give me
any more trouble, remember?

974
01:34:00,924 --> 01:34:01,424
Joyce.

975
01:34:08,181 --> 01:34:12,685
I know you took a risk.

976
01:34:12,686 --> 01:34:17,686
Good luck, Nick.

977
01:34:52,225 --> 01:34:53,809
How you doing, pal?

978
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:58,810
I want to talk to your friend Mr. Sugai.

979
01:35:20,045 --> 01:35:25,045
Ask him to give Sugai this.

980
01:36:24,818 --> 01:36:29,818
What, are we going in there?

981
01:37:08,904 --> 01:37:13,904
You should be Somewhere
over the Pacific now, Conklin.

982
01:37:14,367 --> 01:37:17,578
We should be rid of you.

983
01:37:17,579 --> 01:37:21,457
Do you have any idea who I am?

984
01:37:21,458 --> 01:37:24,126
Yeah, I know who you are.

985
01:37:24,127 --> 01:37:25,711
No.

986
01:37:25,712 --> 01:37:30,712
If you did,
you wouldn't have given me this.

987
01:37:31,968 --> 01:37:33,886
Good stuff.

988
01:37:33,887 --> 01:37:38,015
This is an old bill, a prototype.

989
01:37:38,016 --> 01:37:42,394
The new ones will be
like everything we make...

990
01:37:42,395 --> 01:37:43,813
Perfect.

991
01:37:43,814 --> 01:37:46,315
Perfect, huh?

992
01:37:46,316 --> 01:37:49,068
So, Who's going to get the profits? You?

993
01:37:49,069 --> 01:37:50,903
Or Sato?

994
01:37:50,904 --> 01:37:54,532
See, I know he's got the other plate.

995
01:37:54,533 --> 01:37:57,034
That means you've got nothing.

996
01:37:57,035 --> 01:38:01,747
He might as well be an American.

997
01:38:01,748 --> 01:38:05,918
His kind respectjust one thing,

998
01:38:05,919 --> 01:38:07,002
money.

999
01:38:07,003 --> 01:38:12,003
So what are you into it for? Love?

1000
01:38:30,735 --> 01:38:33,946
Iwaslo

1001
01:38:33,947 --> 01:38:37,283
when the B-29 came.

1002
01:38:37,284 --> 01:38:41,912
My family lived underground
for three days.

1003
01:38:41,913 --> 01:38:46,000
When we came up, the city was gone.

1004
01:38:46,001 --> 01:38:49,712
Then the heat brought rain,

1005
01:38:49,713 --> 01:38:52,423
black rain.

1006
01:38:52,424 --> 01:38:56,343
You made the rain black

1007
01:38:56,344 --> 01:39:01,181
and shoved your Values down our throat.

1008
01:39:01,182 --> 01:39:04,810
We forgot who we were.

1009
01:39:04,811 --> 01:39:09,773
You created Sato
and the thousands like him.

1010
01:39:09,774 --> 01:39:14,403
"M loaying you back."

1011
01:39:14,404 --> 01:39:19,404
Hey, you want the plate?
You get me close to him.

1012
01:39:20,827 --> 01:39:24,330
You have no part in this.

1013
01:39:24,331 --> 01:39:26,832
I promised the other oyabuns

1014
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:29,835
there would be peace.

1015
01:39:29,836 --> 01:39:31,629
They don't have to know.

1016
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:36,630
I'm bound by duty and honor.

1017
01:39:36,635 --> 01:39:38,802
If you had time,

1018
01:39:38,803 --> 01:39:42,681
I would explain what that means.

1019
01:39:42,682 --> 01:39:45,017
Sugai-san.

1020
01:39:45,018 --> 01:39:49,688
I am the solution to your problems.

1021
01:39:49,689 --> 01:39:53,275
I can take him out. Okay?

1022
01:39:53,276 --> 01:39:57,446
I'm nothing but a worthless <i>gaijin</i>

1023
01:39:57,447 --> 01:40:00,074
and everybody knows
he killed my partner.

1024
01:40:00,075 --> 01:40:02,785
Yeah.

1025
01:40:02,786 --> 01:40:05,079
Right in front of you.

1026
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:09,875
I'm not impressed.

1027
01:40:09,876 --> 01:40:14,876
You get me close, I'll hit the mark

1028
01:40:14,881 --> 01:40:17,216
and you're going to be clean.

1029
01:40:17,217 --> 01:40:21,679
Why should I trust you?

1030
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:26,680
Because you got nothing to lose.

1031
01:41:26,286 --> 01:41:31,123
Four oyabuns will arrive here shortly

1032
01:41:31,124 --> 01:41:34,209
with their bodyguards.

1033
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:39,210
Sato will also have a lieutenant.

1034
01:45:14,555 --> 01:45:19,309
But sometimes you have to go for it.

1035
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:24,310
Thanks, pal.

1036
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:26,733
This is not a farmer.

1037
01:45:26,734 --> 01:45:28,110
What?

1038
01:45:28,111 --> 01:45:33,111
This is one of Sato's men.

1039
01:45:33,616 --> 01:45:36,952
He's got his own double cross going on.

1040
01:45:36,953 --> 01:45:41,953
Wonder how many of these other guys
are his men.

1041
01:45:44,794 --> 01:45:46,712
- Okay, I'm going in.
- What?

1042
01:45:46,713 --> 01:45:49,715
I'm going in.
You cover the front, all right?

1043
01:45:49,716 --> 01:45:54,716
You can do it. Okay, Mas?
You can do it.

1044
01:47:17,011 --> 01:47:22,011
Sato, sit here.

1045
01:47:38,658 --> 01:47:42,077
You must learn to value
our Yakuza code

1046
01:47:42,078 --> 01:47:47,078
over your individual desires.

1047
01:47:49,836 --> 01:47:54,836
If I am granted
the recognition I deserve...

1048
01:47:55,133 --> 01:47:59,511
my loyalty will set a new standard.

1049
01:47:59,512 --> 01:48:04,512
Where's the plate?

1050
01:48:08,062 --> 01:48:13,062
Where's the other plate?

1051
01:48:15,194 --> 01:48:20,194
In a safe place.

1052
01:48:33,254 --> 01:48:34,880
Sato.

1053
01:48:34,881 --> 01:48:38,216
First you must accept responsibility

1054
01:48:38,217 --> 01:48:40,969
for your past deeds...

1055
01:48:40,970 --> 01:48:45,970
by making amends
in the traditional manner.

1056
01:48:49,729 --> 01:48:54,729
If you refuse, there will be no truce!

1057
01:51:13,164 --> 01:51:16,082
Now come sit beside me.

1058
01:51:16,083 --> 01:51:21,083
We will toast our truce.

1059
01:51:42,735 --> 01:51:47,735
Take the cup.

1060
01:52:03,756 --> 01:52:08,756
I got him!

1061
01:52:18,854 --> 01:52:19,354
Shit.

1062
01:57:33,252 --> 01:57:38,252
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1063
01:58:02,197 --> 01:58:05,116
- So you made the news again.
- Yeah.

1064
01:58:05,117 --> 01:58:07,702
You're a regular hero.

1065
01:58:07,703 --> 01:58:11,205
So, what did you decide?
Are you going to stay here?

1066
01:58:11,206 --> 01:58:13,082
I don't know.

1067
01:58:13,083 --> 01:58:16,794
A love-hate relationship
can last a very long time.

1068
01:58:16,795 --> 01:58:17,295
Yeah.

1069
01:58:21,759 --> 01:58:24,761
I want to thank you.

1070
01:58:24,762 --> 01:58:29,762
- For what?
- For choosing a side.

1071
01:58:36,899 --> 01:58:41,402
You're welcome.

1072
01:58:41,403 --> 01:58:43,279
- Hot pepper?
- No, thanks.

1073
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:47,742
<i>Flight 159 for Tokyo
and Washington, D. C.,</i>

1074
01:58:47,743 --> 01:58:51,662
<i>now boarding at Gate 4.</i>

1075
01:58:51,663 --> 01:58:54,332
Come on, don't give me that sad look.

1076
01:58:54,333 --> 01:58:59,170
You know, they never found the plates.

1077
01:58:59,171 --> 01:59:02,256
Not in the house, not in the road.

1078
01:59:02,257 --> 01:59:06,260
Well, some lucky bastard,
he's probably set for life.

1079
01:59:06,261 --> 01:59:08,721
I don't think I understand.

1080
01:59:08,722 --> 01:59:12,350
If you got the two plates
and you know the right people,

1081
01:59:12,351 --> 01:59:15,103
then all your problems are solved.

1082
01:59:15,104 --> 01:59:20,104
I mean, Who's ever going to know?

1083
01:59:20,692 --> 01:59:23,945
<i>This is final boarding announcement
for Northwest...</i>

1084
01:59:23,946 --> 01:59:25,696
I'm getting good at this, huh?

1085
01:59:25,697 --> 01:59:30,697
<i>Flight 26,
service to Detroit and New York,</i>

1086
01:59:30,702 --> 01:59:35,702
<i>please proceed to Gate 5.</i>

1087
01:59:37,793 --> 01:59:40,002
I don't want you coming to the gate,
okay?

1088
01:59:40,003 --> 01:59:41,045
Why?

1089
01:59:41,046 --> 01:59:45,716
Because I know you. You're gonna...
You're going to get sentimental.

1090
01:59:45,717 --> 01:59:50,717
It's embarrassing.

1091
01:59:51,515 --> 01:59:55,434
Nick-san.

1092
01:59:55,435 --> 01:59:57,645
What did you get me? A bento box?

1093
01:59:57,646 --> 02:00:00,189
I can eat it on the airplane
instead of that American shit.

1094
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:03,234
No. It's for your kids.

1095
02:00:03,235 --> 02:00:06,863
Thanks.

1096
02:00:06,864 --> 02:00:11,864
Oh, I got something here for you.

1097
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:21,794
No, Nick-san.

1098
02:00:21,795 --> 02:00:26,795
Good friends do this.

1099
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:33,260
You watch your tail, cowboy.

1100
02:00:59,875 --> 02:01:00,487
<i>Nick-san!</i>
