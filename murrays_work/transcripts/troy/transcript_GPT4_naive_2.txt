[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

[Odysseus]: A war that will be sung about for generations, my friend.
[Achilles]: I care not for Agamemnon's war.
[Odysseus]: This war will be remembered, Achilles, not as Agamemnon's, but as the war where heroes were born.
[Achilles]: Heroes, perhaps. But pawns as well. And I've grown weary of being a pawn.
[Odysseus]: And yet, even the greatest heroes are remembered because they chose the right battles.
[Achilles]: I choose my battles, not because of some king's whim, but because they are worthy of my name.
[Odysseus]: And what battle could be more worthy than one against Troy, where the greatest of warriors shall clash?
[Achilles]: A battle where glory is not tainted by the ambitions of men unworthy of it.
[Odysseus]: Glory, Achilles, is not dictated by the whims of kings, but by the deeds of warriors.
[Patroclus]: And wouldn't defeating the Trojans be the greatest deed of all?
[Achilles]: Patroclus, your heart is brave, but bravery without wisdom is a danger to oneself.
[Odysseus]: Wisdom and bravery together, Achilles, can carve a name into eternity.
[Achilles]: And yet, Odysseus, I must ask, whose name would truly be carved? The warrior's or the king who sends him?
[Odysseus]: The name that will echo through eternity is that of the warrior who rises above kings, who stands unmatched on the battlefield.
[Achilles]: And yet, I have risen above kings, and still, they seek to control me.
[Odysseus]: Because they fear you, Achilles. Fear is the shadow cast by greatness.
[Achilles]: Then let them fear me from their palaces and thrones. I am no one's puppet.
[Odysseus]: And yet, Achilles, even a lion must leave its den to show its strength to the world.
[Achilles]: And when the lion leaves, does he do so to prove himself, or because he hungers?
