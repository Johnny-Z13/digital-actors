Narrator: A woman comes by with a trolley full of sweets, she asks the kids if they want anything off the trolley. Ron talks then
Ron: No thanks, I'm all set. \smiles awkwardly and pats his sandwich-packed pockets\
Harry: Oh, I'll take some of everything, please. \smiles eagerly\ So, you're Ron, right? What's in those sandwiches?
Ron: Yeah, just some corned beef sandwiches my mum made. \laughs a bit\ They're a bit squished from the ride though. Fancy one?
Harry: Oh, no thanks, Ron. I appreciate the offer though! \laughs and looks at the sandwiches\ But tell me, how's life at Hogwarts? I'm really curious, it's all so new to me.
Ron: Oh, well, I actually haven't started at Hogwarts yet. This is my first year too! \looks excited\ I've heard loads about it from my brothers though. They've told me all sorts of stories. There's this one spell, "COLORUS RATTUS," supposed to turn a rat yellow! Always wanted to try it out. \grins and shrugs\ What about you, what have you heard about Hogwarts?
Harry: That sounds like a fun spell! I haven't learned any spells yet, but I'm eager to start. I've heard that Hogwarts has houses, like teams, and I'm curious to find out which one I'll be in. Have your brothers mentioned anything about how they decide that? \looks intrigued\
Ron: Oh, absolutely, they sort us into houses based on what we're best at, I think. There's Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each one's got its own sort of... well, personality, you could say. My whole family's been in Gryffindor, so I reckon I'll end up there too. What about you, any idea where you might fit in? \leans forward curiously\
Harry: No clue, really. I guess I'll find out when I get there. It's exciting, isn't it? \smiles\ By the way, do you know why Hogwarts was founded? I'm trying to learn as much as I can about the magical world.
Ron: Blimey, Hogwarts history, that's a bit of a tale! From what my dad's told me, it was founded over a thousand years ago by four wizards: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They each wanted to teach magic, but they all had different ideas about who should be taught. That's why they created the houses! Each house reflects the founder's personality and values. \nods enthusiastically\ So, each year, the Sorting Hat chooses where we best fit based on those qualities! How cool is that?
Narrator: \A bit later, Harry and Ron are now sitting together eating bundles of sweets. Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over his head.\
Narrator: \Harry sees a sweet called Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans\
Narrator: \There is a blue and gold package between the sweets Harry hadn't noticed until now\
Narrator: \There was a chocolate frog in the packet that jumps onto the window and climbs up.\
Narrator: \The frog reaches the open gap in the window and jumps out.\ 
Harry: Oh, wow, did you see that? The chocolate frog just jumped out the window! \laughs and looks amazed\ I guess everything truly is magical here, even the sweets! What other magical treats should I try from this trolley?
Ron: Oh, definitely try some Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, but be careful, mate, you never know what you're gonna get! Could be chocolate, could be... well, bogey-flavoured. \laughs\ It's a bit of a gamble, that's for sure!
Narrator: \Harry sees an image of Dumbledore in the card.\
Narrator: \Harry looks at the card again, but Dumbledore has vanished.\
Narrator: \Scabbers squeaks\
Narrator: \A girl with bushy brown hair, dressed in robes, appears at the doorway.\
Hermione: Hello, I'm Hermione Granger. \looks at both boys with a serious expression\ Have either of you seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one. We're trying to find it.
Ron: Oh, a toad? No, haven't seen one, but we could help look for it if you want. \smiles at Hermione\ This here's Scabbers, he's my rat, not a toad though. \holds up Scabbers slightly\ What's this toad look like then?
Hermione: Thank you, Ron. The toad is quite small and belongs to Neville Longbottom; he's rather distressed about it. \looks around the compartment briefly\ By the way, that spell you mentioned earlier, "COLORUS RATTUS," isn't actually a standard spell. Perhaps you meant the "COLLOVARIA" spell, which indeed changes the color of an object. \smiles politely\ It's important to get the incantations right to avoid unintended effects.
Ron: Blimey, really? Guess my brothers were having a bit of a laugh at my expense then. \chuckles\ Thanks for the heads-up, Hermione! We'll keep an eye out for Neville's toad while we're at it. \looks out into the corridor\ What's Hogwarts been like for you so far?
Hermione: Well, I've only just boarded the train, so I haven't quite experienced Hogwarts yet. However, I am thoroughly prepared and quite excited about the classes. \glances at the sweets scattered around\ Speaking of preparation, have you heard about Hogwarts' extensive library? It's supposed to have thousands of books on every magical subject you can imagine! I can't wait to explore it. \looks hopeful\ Perhaps we could study together sometime, if you'd like.
Harry: Oh, that sounds brilliant, Hermione! I'd love to study together and learn more about magic. \smiles warmly\ And the library sounds like a treasure trove of knowledge! Count me in for a library adventure. \nods enthusiastically\ And about Neville's toad, we'll definitely keep our eyes peeled. Maybe it hopped its way here; creatures seem to have a knack for adventure here! \grins\
