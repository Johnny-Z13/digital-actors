## Production Notes

### Optimization Priorities
1. String board is gameplay element - must be readable, high detail
2. Rotary telephone is hero prop - player stares at it during call
3. Window rain + neon creates signature noir atmosphere
4. Desk lamp lighting is critical for mood
5. Venetian blind shadows are iconic noir visual

### Sound Design Cues (Visual Integration)
- Rain: visible on window, constant visual element
- Phone ring: rotary bell visible in phone body
- Distant traffic: implied by neon lights, urban setting
- Paper rustle: visible case files on desk
- Static: old intercom or radio visible

### Avoid
- ❌ Bright/modern lighting (must be dark, dramatic)
- ❌ Clean/organized space (gritty, lived-in)
- ❌ Modern technology (no computers, cell phones, LED lights)
- ❌ Daytime atmosphere (must be nocturnal)
- ❌ Empty desk (must feel active, case in progress)
