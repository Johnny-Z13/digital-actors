Eliza: So your pod id tells me you're a zoologist. That might be helpful for our terraforming mission, but with the fleet malfunctioning you need to find a bona fide engineer.
Eliza: Activating your eye-OS implant so you can scan the room for an engineer in stasis. Hang on, this won't take long.
Eliza: Did it work? You should be seeing a sort of advanced visual interface.
Player: Yeah, it's working, I can see outlines and info panels next to the pods.
Eliza: Good, now try saying "Luna Scan", that should activate the scanner on your eye-OS.
Player: Luna Scan.
Eliza: Okay, so you should be seeing names, class, and pod ids. Can you find an engineer?
Player: Okay, I see one, John Lusty, engineering, ID is ED 3122.
Computer: WRONG ID
Eliza: Okay, read the pod id back to me slowly.
Computer: ENGINEER ID
Player: Okay, it's ED 3122.
Eliza: Okay, I'm attempting to wake Engineer Lusty remotely.
Player: It’s not looking good, there's an error message on the pod and... wait, now it's on fire!
