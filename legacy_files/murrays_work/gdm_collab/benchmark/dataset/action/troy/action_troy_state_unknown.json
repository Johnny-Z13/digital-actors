         "Odysseus: \\smiling\\ Your reputation for hospitality is fast becoming legend.",
            "Achilles: I don't like that smile, my friend. It's the smile you smile when you want me to fight in another war.",
            "Patroclus: \\Is looking to both of them trying to understand who is this stranger\\",
            "Achilles: \\grabs his cousin to make him face Odysseus\\ Patroclus, my cousin \\looks towards Odysseus smiling\\ Odysseus, king of Ithaca.",
            "Odysseus: Patroclus, son of Menoetius?",
            "Patroclus: \\nods,\\",
            "Odysseus: \\grips Patroclus's shoulder\\ I knew your parents well. I miss them.",
            "Patroclus: \\nods again, looking at his feet\\.",
            "Odysseus: Now you have this one watching over you, eh? Learning from Achilles himself -- every boy in Greece must be jealous.",
            "Odysseus: \\to Achilles\\ We need to talk.",
            "Achilles: Tell me you're not here at Agamemnon's bidding.",
            "Odysseus: \\hesitates\\",
            "Achilles: \\shakes his head\\ How many times have I done the savage work for the King of Kings? And when has he ever shown me the respect I've earned?",
            "Odysseus: I'm not asking you to fight for him. I'm asking you to fight for the Greeks.",
            "Achilles: Why? Are the Greeks tired of fighting each other? The Trojans never did anything to me.",
            "Odysseus: For now, but the Trojans insulted Greece",
            "Achilles: They insulted one Greek, a man who couldn't hold on to his wife. What business is that of mine?",
            "Odysseus: Your business is war, my friend.",
            "Achilles: \\angry\\ Is it? Am I the whore of the battlefield? Can my sword be bought and sold? \beat; calmer\\ I don't want to be remembered as a tyrant's mercenary.",
            "Odysseus: Forget Agamemnon. Fight for me. My wife will feel much better if she knows you're by my side. I'll feel much better.",
            "Patroclus: Is Ajax going to fight in Troy?",
            "Odysseus: Of course. You've heard of Ajax, eh?",
            "Patroclus: They say he can fell an oak tree with one swing of the axe.",
            "Achilles: Trees don't swing back.",
            "Odysseus: \\chuckles, but he's alert to the boy's enthusiasm\\.We're sending the largest fleet that ever sailed -- a thousand ships.",
            "Patroclus: A thousand ships! Prince Hector, is he as good a warrior as they say?",
            "Odysseus: The best of all the Trojans. Some say he's better than all the Greeks, too...",
            "Achilles: \\grins\\",
            "Odysseus: Even if your cousin doesn't come, Patroclus, I hope you'll join us. We could use a strong arm like yours.",
            "Patroclus: \\beams with pride and looks at his cousin\\",
            "Achilles: \\wraps his arm around Odysseus's shoulders and leans closer to the Ithacan. The embrace is friendly, but there's no mistaking the power in Achilles' grip\\ Play your tricks on me, if you'd like. But leave my cousin out of it.",
            "Odysseus: You have your sword, I have my tricks. We play with the toys the gods give us.",
            "Odysseus: \\goes back to his horse and mounts\\.",
            "Odysseus: We sail for Troy in three days... This war will never be forgotten. Nor will the heroes who fight in it.",
            "Patroclus: \\eager but frustrated, watches him ride away."
