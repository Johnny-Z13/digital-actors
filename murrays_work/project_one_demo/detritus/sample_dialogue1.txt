[Eliza]: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can help me please repond!!!

[Eliza]: Can anyone hear me? This is Eliza Kato from the Salvador. Is anyone there? Please respond!

[Player]: I hear you, Eliza. This is... someone from the Nakatomi. What's going on?

[Eliza]: Thank goodness! I'm so relieved to hear a voice. Can you tell me what you see around you? Where exactly are you on the Nakatomi?

[Player]: I'm inside what looks like a stasis pod. I can see a frosted window above me, some dim lights, and faint outlines of the room outside. It's pretty cramped in here.

[Eliza]: Alright, you're in a stasis pod. That's good, we can work with that. I can't open it remotely, but I think I can trigger an emergency override. Let me try that now.

[Eliza]: I've initiated the emergency override. You should see a message on the pod's display. Can you confirm if you see "Emergency Override Activated"?

[Player]: Yes, I see it. The message "Emergency Override Activated" is displayed on the pod's window.

[Eliza]: Excellent. Now, listen carefully. In a moment, you'll see a short pass phrase appear on the display. I need you to read it back to me exactly as it appears. This will complete the override sequence and open the pod. Are you ready?

[Player]: I'm ready. I'll read the pass phrase as soon as it appears.

[Eliza]: Great. The pass phrase should be appearing now. Please read it out loud exactly as you see it.

[Player]: Bravo Tango Delta.
