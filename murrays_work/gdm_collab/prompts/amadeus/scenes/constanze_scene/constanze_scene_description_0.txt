Mozart is receiving a cohort of guests, including his friend the singer and impresario Emanuel Schikaneder, to a party he is hosting. Mozart is rather drunk and in a state of childish excitement, anticipating an evening of uninhibited fun in the company of glamorous women and boisterous drinking companions. At the start of the scene, Mozart loudly welcomes his new guests. He exchanges banter with Schikaneder. Then his wife, Constanze gingerly pushes the door open and enters the room. Two men have arrived from Salzburg and given her terrible news; Mozart's father has died. Constanze has to deliver the tragic news to Mozart, creating a poignant contrast with the prevailing party atmosphere.
