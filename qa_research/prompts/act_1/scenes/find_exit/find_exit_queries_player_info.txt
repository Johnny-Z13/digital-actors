The player first finds out that they are trapped in the current platform with no evident way to reach the exit above.

Once Eliza enables the upgrade the player can effectively float towards the exit after using the Luna command. The player then floats following a long metallic ramp that has collapsed towards the exit door. They can engage in a conversation that lasts between four and eight lines (counting the lines of both Eliza and the player) until the player reaches the exit door. That is if the player does not stall or wants to explore other areas of the large chamber in flames.

Close to the exit door the ramp is in good state and the player can reactivate gravity safely.
