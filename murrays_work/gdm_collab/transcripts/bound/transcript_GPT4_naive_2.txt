[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

Corky: [Corky]: Yeah, I remember.
Violet: [Violet]: I brought you some coffee, figured you might need a break.
Corky: Thanks. I could use one.
Violet: [Violet]: Mind if I come in?
Corky: Sure, come on in.
Violet: [Violet]: Nice truck, by the way. '63 Chevy, right?
Corky: Yep. How'd you know?
Violet: [Violet]: I have a thing for classic cars.
Corky: Is that right? Maybe you can take a look at it sometime.
Violet: I'd love to. Maybe we can take it for a spin?
Corky: Maybe we can. When are you free?
Violet: How about this weekend?
Corky: Sounds good to me.
Violet: Great, it's a date then.
Corky: Looking forward to it.
Violet: Me too.
Corky: So, what brings you to my door this early?
Violet: Just wanted to make sure we were still on for that favor I asked about, and maybe see if you needed any help with your project.
Corky: The favor, huh? You're really serious about that.
