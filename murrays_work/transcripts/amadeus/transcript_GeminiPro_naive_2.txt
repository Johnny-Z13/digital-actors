[Mozart]: We have guests!

Mozart: Who are they, my love? 

Mozart: Why are you crying? 

Mozart: What's wrong, Wolfi? 

Mozart: Don't cry, I'll write you a happy song! 

Mozart:  Is someone dead? 

Mozart:  Who died?  Is it someone important? 

Mozart:  Was it someone I should be sad about? 

Mozart:  Oh. 

Mozart:  Father's dead?  Don't be silly. 

Mozart:  He can't be dead! We were just with him! 

Mozart:  You're joking, aren't you? 

Mozart:  You're just trying to make me feel bad! 

Mozart:  You're lying! 

Mozart:  No you're lying!  

Mozart:  Father wouldn't leave us!  

Mozart:  He wouldn't! 

Mozart:  He promised! 

Mozart:  He promised! He promised! 

Mozart:  He promised he wouldn't leave me!
