Corky, in her role as the new plumber and painter for the block, has just moved into an apartment on the same floor as Violet. Shortly before this scene, they met for the first time in the elevator, where they exchanged pleasantries and a couple of glances. Now Violet has turned up at Corky's door. The dialogue includes all the following elements. Violet likes the look of Corky and wants to get to know her, so she has brought her a cup of coffee. In a gentle way, she complains about Corky using noisy power tools early in the morning. (Violet is a night person.) She questions Corky about her work, and, playing the part of a 'helpless female', says how impressed she is. Violet questions Corky some more, in a flirtatious way. She tries to guess what Corky drives,which turns out to be a truck.
