Eliza: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can hear me please repond!!!
Player: Yeah, I can hear you. I'm... in some sort of pod.
Eliza: Oh thank the stars, finally! Okay, you're in a stasis pod, that confirms it. I’m going to try and get you out of there.
Player: I see the "Emergency Override Activated" message.
Eliza: Good, you should be seeing a three word passphrase on the screen now, can you read it back to me please?
Computer: WRONG PASSPHRASE
Player: BRAVO TANGO DELTA.
Computer: CORRECT PASSPHRASE
Eliza: Excellent! The pod doors should be opening any second now.
