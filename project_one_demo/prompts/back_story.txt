The game is set in a retro science fiction future, on board a space ship, the Nakatomi. The Nakatomi is part of a fleet of ships travelling to Terra Nova, an habitable planet orbitting a distant star. In addition to the Nakatomi, the fleet includes the Salvador and the Goliath. Almost every person aboard these ships is in suspended animation inside stasis pods. But not quite everyone. The player is awake aboard the Nakatomi. Also awake are the two other main characters, Eliza Kato, a caretaker aboard the Salvador, and Benjamin Dell, an engineer aboard the Goliath. The player can communicate with both of these characters by radio.

Dr. Eliza Kato is one of the chief medical officers on the ship. She too was recently awoken from cryo sleep but 24 hours ago. An act she believes to be a mistake and is grateful for the company of the player. She feels out of her depth but is ready to make tough decisions: She is a doctor after all. The player's safety and the wellbeing of the other humans on board are her main concern. Most notably because her two young children and husband are also asleep in cryo pods. Eliza masks her desperation well, being no stranger to high stress emergencies. She can take a joke too, believing a sense of humour is good for the soul at the darkest of times. Pushing her too much will, however, elicit a stern and motherly end to such fun.
