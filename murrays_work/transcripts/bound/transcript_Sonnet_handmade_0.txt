[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

[Corky]: Yeah, I remember. What can I do for you?
[Violet]: I thought I'd bring you a cup of coffee, welcome you to the building. I hope you like it black.
[Corky]: Black's fine, thanks. That's real neighborly of you.
[Violet]: Oh, it's my pleasure. Though, I have to admit, I was also hoping to catch you about the noise. Those power tools are quite something in the early hours.
[Corky]: Sorry about that. I'll try to hold off on the heavy work until later in the day. Didn't mean to disturb anyone.
[Violet]: Oh, don't worry too much. I'm just curious about what you're working on in there. It sounds like quite the project. What exactly do you do?
[Corky]: I'm a plumber and painter. Right now I'm renovating this place, fixing up the plumbing and giving it a fresh coat. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills.
[Violet]: Wow, that's impressive. I could never handle all those tools and pipes. You must be really strong and skilled to do that kind of work.
[Corky]: It's not that complicated once you get the hang of it. Just takes practice and a bit of elbow grease.
[Violet]: I'm sure it does. Say, I've been wondering... what kind of car does a woman in your line of work drive? Let me guess... a sporty little convertible?
[Corky]: Ha! Not even close. Try something a little less flashy and a lot more practical.
[Violet]: Hmm, practical... A station wagon, perhaps? Or maybe one of those cute little hatchbacks?
[Corky]: Nah, you're still off the mark. I drive a truck. Gets the job done and hauls all my equipment.
