[Conductor]: Welcome to light rail, The Luminata's number one transport provider.

[Conductor]: We’ll get you where you want to go at lightning speed ... So for the love of god don’t do anything to disrupt your journey for you or your fellow passengers.

[Conductor]: So, where would you like to go, friend?

[Player]: Er, how about the Biome, dude?

[Conductor]: The Biome, huh? Oh jeez, I dunno friend. I really don't like going there any more. I just get this ... *feeling* you know? It's supposed to be a slittle slice of nature... a place of relaxation. But, ever since Celebration Day... well, let's just say I wouldn't want to spoil the vibe, know what I mean? How about one of the other options?

[Player]: But I really want to go to the Biome, man.

[Eliza]: Hey, listen, I know you want to see the Biome, but maybe the conductor's right... it *was* pretty bad there on Celebration Day. Let's just pick somewhere else for now, okay? We don't want to spook the poor guy more than we already have.

[Player]: Shut up, Eliza, I'm talking to the conductor here.

[Eliza]: Okay, okay, no need to get shirty. Just saying, maybe let's humour the guy. There are other places we could go.

[Player]: Hey, Conductor, how can I persuade you to take me to the Biome?

[Eliza]: Look, maybe we can figure out what *really* happened on Celebration Day later, but right now, let's focus on getting to the rendezvous point. Just pick another location, alright?

[Player]: Listen, Eliza, give the Conductor a chance to speak. Conductor, talk to me!

[Conductor]: I'm sorry friend, but I'm afraid my positronic brain is programmed with the well-being of my passengers in mind, and that just wouldn't be doing my job. Can we just, like, move on? Please?

[Player]: Okay, take me to the Upper Decks then.
