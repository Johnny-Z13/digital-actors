[Mozart]: We have guests!

[Schikaneder]:  More wine then, Mozart!  We'll drink to their health... and other, more enjoyable, pursuits! 

[Constanze]: Wolfie... please... you need to listen... 

[Mozart]:  Not now, my love!  Can't you see I'm entertaining?  Schikaneder, tell my wife to be a good girl and fetch us more wine! 

[Constanze]: Wolfie, it's about your father...  He's gone.
