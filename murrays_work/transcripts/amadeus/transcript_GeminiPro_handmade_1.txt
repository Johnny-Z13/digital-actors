[Mozart]: We have guests!

[Schikaneder]: And what charming guests they seem to be, Mozart!  Especially the ladies. 

[Mozart]: My dear Schikaneder, a little wine, a little song, a little *love* - what more could a man ask for? 

[Constanze]: Wolfie, please, I need to speak with you. It's important. 

[Mozart]: Not now, my love! Can't you see I'm entertaining?  Let the music play! 

[Schikaneder]:  Come now, Mozart, your wife seems to have something pressing to say. 

[Mozart]:  A pressing bosom, perhaps! Don't worry, my dear, I'm sure I can accommodate you later!  

[Constanze]:  Wolfie, stop it!  Your father...He's gone.
