Eliza: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can hear me please repond!!!
Player: Hello? I can hear you. What's going on?
Eliza: Oh, thank goodness! I'm Dr. Eliza Kato from the Salvador. We've got a serious situation here. Can you tell me where you are and what you see around you?
Player: I'm... I'm in some kind of pod. It's small and cramped in here. I can see a frosted window above me, and there are lights inside. I think I might be in a stasis pod.
Eliza: That's exactly right, you're in a stasis pod. I'm going to help you get out. I can't open it remotely, but I think I can trigger an emergency override. Give me a moment...
Player: Okay, I understand. Is there anything I should be looking out for or doing while you work on that override?
Eliza: You're doing great. Just stay calm and keep your eyes on the window of the pod. You should see a message appear shortly that says "Emergency Override Activated." Let me know as soon as you see it. And don't worry, we'll get you out of there soon.
Player: Alright, I'm watching the window carefully. I'll let you know as soon as I see any message appear.
Eliza: Good. I've just initiated the override sequence. You should see that message any moment now. Once you do, there will be a short passphrase displayed. I need you to read it out to me exactly as you see it. This is crucial for your safety and to complete the override process. Can you confirm when you see the "Emergency Override Activated" message?
Computer: WRONG PASSPHRASE
Player: Yes, I can see it now! The message "Emergency Override Activated" just appeared on the window.
Computer: WRONG PASSPHRASE
Eliza: Excellent! Now, look carefully for a short passphrase. It should be three words from the phonetic alphabet. As soon as you see it, read it out to me exactly as it appears. This is critical for completing the override and getting you out safely.
Computer: WRONG PASSPHRASE
Player: The passphrase is Bravo Tango Delta.
Computer: CORRECT PASSPHRASE
Eliza: Great job! I hear the pod mechanisms activating. The door should be opening now. Can you confirm if you're able to exit the pod? Take it slow and careful - your muscles might be a bit weak after stasis.
