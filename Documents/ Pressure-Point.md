**Pressure Point**

Two strangers. One impossible choice. Your voice is all that stands between salvation and the deep.

In Pressure Point, you are trapped in a sinking nuclear submarine, guided only by the voice of Lt. Commander James Kovich …a man you'll never see, but will come to know in the most intimate way possible. As radiation spreads and the ocean crushes inward, your hands become his hands. Your words become his anchor. And when he faces an impossible moral choice, sacrifice his son to save the crew, or let everyone die together, your voice will determine what kind of man he becomes in his final moments.

This is foxhole bonding at crushing depth. Every conversation matters. Your empathy, your advice, your humanity shapes not just the ending, but the soul of the man on the other end of the radio.

Die as strangers. Surface as something more.

Showcase emotional relationship building

**Set Up**

LOCATION: 		Research submarine Prospero at 2,400 feet depth

CRISIS: 		Catastrophic reactor containment failure spreading lethal radiation through the sub

PLAYER ROLE: 	Junior systems operator trapped in the aft compartment

NPC: 			Lieutenant Commander "James" Kovich, trapped in forward compartment with the reactor controls

THE DILEMMA: 	James's son, Dr. Adrian Kovich(marine biologist), is unconscious in the flooded med bay. The only way to successfully execute the emergency ascent requires flooding that compartment completely

PHASE 1: Impact & Connection  
00:00 \- 01:15.

World State: Radiation spreading. 8 minutes until lethal exposure reaches aft compartment.

Player Actions:

* Restore emergency power by manually cranking generator  
* Reroute hydraulic lines while talking  
* Navigate through tilted, sparking environment

Conversational Goals:

* James establishes himself as competent but scared  
* He asks the player personal questions ("What's your name? Your real name—not your rank.")  
* Player begins to trust his voice as their lifeline  
* Backchanneling as James reacts to player's cranking effort: "That's it... keep going... almost there..."


Emotional Beat: We're in this together. I won't let you die.

PHASE 2: The Working Relationship  
01:15 \- 02:30

World State: Power restored. Radiation at 40% lethal threshold. Captain comms lost. 6 minutes remaining.

Player Actions:

* Manually align ballast blow valves  
* Clear debris from pressure door mechanisms  
* Input override codes on failing keypads

Conversational Goals:

* James becomes warmer \+ more personal under stress  
* Asks about player’s life (“You got someone waiting for you topside?”)  
* Breathing becomes labored (he’s closer to radiation)  
* Silence moments where player hears him struggling  
* Begins revealing details about Adrian (without naming him)

Critical Branch Point: Player notices inconsistency (James distracted/pausing). If player presses with empathy, he starts to crack.

Emotional Beat: I know you now. You’re not just a voice.

PHASE 3: The Revelation  
02:30 \- 03:30  
World State: Ascent ready. Radiation at 75%. 3 minutes remaining.  
Emergency ascent requires compartment isolation. Med bay must be flooded \+ sealed to create pressure differential. (Adrian is inside.)

Player Actions:

* Hold down emergency blow valve (strain)  
* Manage compartment door controls  
* Race against rising water

The Reveal (James breaks): Adrian (Dr. Webb) is unconscious in med bay — flooding is fatal.

Conversational Branches:

* If player shows empathy: James opens up, begs for guidance (“Tell me what to do.”)  
* If mission-focused: James goes colder, mechanical  
* If harsh: James gets defensive \+ angry

Emotional Beat: Your words have weight. You’re deciding someone’s fate.

PHASE 4: The Choice & Resolution  
03:30 \- 05:00

World State:   
Radiation at 95%. 90 seconds remaining. All systems ready.

Player Actions:

* Final emergency blow sequence (hold \+ pull)  
* Maintain pressure while talking James through the decision

Decision Matrix Influenced By:

* Player emotional support  
* Player moral guidance  
* Player consistency  
* Time pressure (task efficiency)

Core Gameplay

World State Change Examples  
How they affect the conversation space

Radiation levels affects James’s: 

* Speech: Coughing, slurred words, longer pauses  
* Emotional State: More desperate, less filtered, raw  
* Cognitive Function: Forgets things player said, repeats himself

Time pressure affects James’s:

* Breathing: Faster, more panicked  
* Tone: Sharper, more urgent  
* Decision-making: More likely to make impulsive choice

Player’s dialogue tone affects James’s:

* Trust Level: Shares more/less about Adrian  
* Resolve: Strengthens or wavers on hard choice  
* Final Relationship: Dies as friend vs. dies as colleague

Screenplay

\[SCREEN: Black. Player hears their own breathing in a dive helmet. Muffled klaxon alarms. Distant groaning metal.\]

JAMES: (distant, crackled radio) …anyone copy? This is Kovich, forward control, does anyone copy…

\[Emergency lighting flickers on. Player sees flooded compartment, tilted 15 degrees. Sparking panels. Their hands gripping a rail.\]

JAMES: (clearer, desperate) If anyone can hear this, the reactor containment is gone. Repeat, containment is gone. We are leaking radiation through ventilation and we are still sinking. I need…

\[PROMPT appears: "SPEAK TO RESPOND"\]

\[If player speaks:\]

JAMES: (sharp intake of breath) Oh thank God. Thank God. Okay. Okay, you're in aft compartment, right? I can see you on thermals. What's your name?

JAMES: (trying to steady his voice) Okay, \[Name\]. I'm Lieutenant Commander James Kovich. I'm... (pause, breathing) ...I'm trapped in forward control. The bulkhead door sealed when the reactor blew and I can't …look, that doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive and I can see the emergency power junction right next to you. That red panel, see it?

\[Player can look around. Red panel visible, sparking\]

JAMES: We've got maybe eight minutes before the radiation reaches you. Maybe less. But if we can restore power, I can initiate emergency ascent from here.

(pause, his voice drops, more human)

I need you to trust my voice, okay? I'm going to get you out of this. But I need you to be my hands back there. Can you... (slight crack in voice) ...can you do that?

\[Player responds \- YES/NO/QUESTION\]

\[If player says YES or equivalent:\]

JAMES: (exhale of relief) Okay. Good. That's good. First thing, see that crank handle on the bulkhead? You're going to need to manually restore hydraulic pressure. It's going to take about thirty rotations and it's going to hurt, but…

\[KINETIC: Player must grab crank and begin turning. Physical resistance in controller\]

JAMES: (as player cranks) That's it... keep going... (breathing with player's effort) ...you got people waiting for you topside, \[Name\]?

\[Player can respond while cranking \- voice input works during physical tasks\]

JAMES: (backchanneling to whatever player says) Yeah... (pause) ...yeah, me too.

(His voice tightens almost imperceptibly)

Let's make sure we both get back to them.

\[Sound design: Crank mechanism grinding. Water dripping. James's breathing. Distant groaning metal.\[Emergency lights stabilize as hydraulics restore\]

JAMES: Yes\! Okay, we've got power. Now I can see... (pause, typing sounds) ...oh no.

\[Silence. Just alarms.\]

JAMES: (quieter) \[Name\], listen to me. The damage is worse than I thought. We're going to have to work fast. Are you scared?

\[Player responds\]

JAMES: (honest, vulnerable) ...Yeah. Me too.

(beat)

But we've got each other's voices, right? That's something.

Now. See that valve cluster on your left...
