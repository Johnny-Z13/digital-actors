[Eliza]: Okay, I see you’re finally outside.  Now you just need to find the Hab.  Can you see a ... a thing that looks like a big, a big bubble?

[Player]: I see it, yes

[Eliza]: Great! Just head towards it, nice and slow. And hey, what do you say we pass the time with a little chat? Tell me something... anything! What were you doing before... well, you know... before the long sleep?

[Player]: Oh, I was on another mission. A short one that time. But it was, well, kind of confidential, so I can't tell you much more.

[Eliza]: Confidential, huh? Ooh, mysterious! So, like, super-spy stuff? Or more of a "don't ask, don't tell" kind of mission?

[Player]: Just commercial secrecy crap

[Eliza]: Ugh, commercial secrets. The *worst* kind of secrets! Still, gotta pay the bills, right? Did you… did you enjoy it at all? The work, I mean.

[Player]: Let me tell you a bit about where I grew up

[Eliza]: Ooh, I'm all ears! Lay it on me - small town? Big city? Maybe a cool space station like this one, but, you know, *working*?

[Player]: Not a space ship, no. Ha ha. Big city. London, to be precise.

[Eliza]: London! Wow, I've only seen it in vids. Always wanted to visit. Did you ever hit up any of the old museums? I'm a sucker for history.

[Player]: London has an amazing science museum. I did go there a lot as a kid. Used to love the robot floor.

[Eliza]: Robots, huh? Okay, that's officially cool. Did you ever dream of building your own? I bet you had all sorts of crazy inventions planned!

[Player]: Hey eliza, I'm at the Hab now.
