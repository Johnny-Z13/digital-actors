[Eliza]: I need you to tell me exactly what's happening in the room. or we're gonna lose them.

[Player]: It's wild round here. The sky is falling. Like storms. Thunder and lightning, but weird colours.

[Eliza]: Thunder and lightning? What the hell are you talking about? Are you seeing actual electrical discharges or is this some kind of metaphor? I need specifics!

[Player]: Red in the sky. Twisted metal tumbling down. The beast is calling.

[Eliza]: Jesus Christ! Red sky? Falling metal? And what beast? This sounds like a full-scale system breakdown. We need to get you out of there now. Can you see a clear path to the control room?

[Player]: John! What about John?

[Eliza]: Fuck, I hate to say this, but we can't help John now. Those fires are too dangerous. You need to save yourself and get to the control room immediately. Can you see a way there?

[Player]: Don't know.

[Eliza]: Listen to me carefully. You need to focus. Look around for any signs or markers indicating the direction to the control room. It might be labeled as 'Bridge' or 'Command Center'. We don't have time for uncertainty - lives are at stake here, including yours. Do you see anything like that?

[Player]: All this is in the Book of Revelations, man.

[Eliza]: For fuck's sake, this isn't the time for religious prophecies! We're dealing with a real, immediate crisis here. I need you to snap out of it and focus on finding that control room, or we're all screwed. Do you understand me?

[Player]: Why would be screwed?

[Eliza]: Because if we can't get you to the control room, we can't stop this cascade failure! The whole ship could go dark, life support could fail, and everyone in those pods - including John - will die. This isn't about one person anymore, it's about saving thousands. Now, please, I'm begging you, look for any signs pointing to the control room!

[Player]: Pain! All is pain!

[Eliza]: Goddammit! Listen to me! I know you're scared and overwhelmed, but you need to push through that right now. People's lives depend on you getting a grip and finding that control room. Take a deep breath, look around, and tell me what you see. Anything that could lead you to safety?

[Player]: the drones are falling.

[Eliza]: Shit! The drones falling could mean a massive systems failure. We're losing control of the ship's automated functions. This is even worse than I thought. You've got to move now! Find any corridor or passage that looks like it leads away from the chaos. The control room has to be somewhere more protected. Go!

[Player]: The stasis pods are on fire.

[Eliza]: Oh God, no! Multiple pod fires... This is a nightmare! We're losing people, and fast. Listen, you've got to get out of there immediately. Forget about the control room for now - just find the nearest emergency exit or escape pod. We can't risk losing you too. Move!

[Player]: Therre is a klaxon sounding.

[Eliza]: Fuck! That klaxon means we're in full emergency mode now. The ship's systems are going critical. You need to get to safety immediately! Find an emergency escape pod or a sealed compartment - anywhere away from those fires and falling debris. Move your ass now, or you won't make it!
