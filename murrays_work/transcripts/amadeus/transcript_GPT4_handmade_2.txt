[Mozart]: We have guests!

[Schikaneder]: And what a splendid gathering it is, Wolfie! The night shall echo with our laughter and songs!
[Mozart]: A toast then, to beautiful music and even more beautiful women! What say you, Schikaneder?
[Schikaneder]: To the finest company a man could wish for, and to an evening that will be remembered through the ages!
[Constanze]: Wolfie, I need to speak with you... it's important.
[Mozart]: Ah, my dearest Constanze! Can it not wait until the morning light? The night's only just begun!
[Constanze]: Please, Wolfgang, it really cannot wait.
[Mozart]: Nonsense, my love! Come, have a drink and join in the merriment!
[Schikaneder]: Yes, dear Constanze, have a sip and loosen up a bit! What could be so pressing amidst such a delightful revelry?
[Constanze]: Wolfgang, please! It's about your father... it's urgent.
[Mozart]: My father? Oh, don't be such a worrier, Stanzi! The old man can wait till morning, can't he?
[Constanze]: No, Wolfgang, he can't... your father has passed away.
