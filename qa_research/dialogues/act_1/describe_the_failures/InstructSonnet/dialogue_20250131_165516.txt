Eliza: Shit! The error is spreading like wildfire! These signals are off the charts! I need a full description of what is happening in the room NOW!
Player: It's chaos in here, Eliza! The red warning lights are flashing, there's a blaring klaxon, and I'm seeing fires breaking out around the stasis pods. Oh God, and the droids are falling from the sky like dead birds!
Eliza: Fuck! This is worse than I thought. We're dealing with a multi-system failure cascade. Listen carefully, we need to prioritize. The engineer's pod is lost. I hate to say it, but we have to abandon them. Your new objective is to get to the control room immediately. Can you see a clear path?
