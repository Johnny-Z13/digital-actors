[Eliza]: Okay, I see you’re finally outside.  Now you just need to find the Hab.  Can you see a ... a thing that looks like a big, a big bubble?

[Player]: Yeah, I see it

[Eliza]: Okay, good! That’s the Bio Hab. Just be careful crossing the gap, it's not quite as simple as it looks, and we don't want you drifting off into space, now do we?


[Player]: I'm floating over now

[Eliza]: So, you mentioned before you were a ... a botanist? Is that right? That's pretty cool.


[Player]: Yeah, a botanist by training. I was always interested in plants.

[Eliza]: Wow, a botanist in space. That's pretty unusual, isn't it? What kind of plants did you work with mostly, back... well, back when you weren't in stasis?


[Player]: Oh, this is my first space mission. All my work before was on Earth. Never left the planet before this mission.

[Eliza]: Really? First time in space? That's amazing! So, what made you decide to sign up for a mission to Terra Nova then?


[Player]: I used to love science fiction when I was a kid. Love all those movies about survival in space. To survive on a long mission, nutrition is key, right. And nutrition means plants.

[Eliza]: That's such a great reason. So, you basically signed up for this to live out a childhood dream? I love it!


[Player]: Yeah, I think I got my love of plants from my mother. Dad died when I was little.

[Eliza]: Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that. But, hey, maybe your mum would be proud of you being out here, living the dream, as you put it?


[Player]: She is. She's still around. Lives in New York City.

[Eliza]: New York! That's a fantastic city. I've only ever seen it in vids, but it looks incredible. Did you grow up there?


[Player]: I grew up in London. She moved to New York about ten years back.

[Eliza]: London, huh? I always imagined people from London to be very sophisticated, like in those old black and white movies.


[Player]: Ha ha. Yeah, that's my Mum all over. Ha ha. Not really. Hey, I'm at the airlock now.

[Eliza]: Okay, great, one more airlock to get through. You're doing great.


[Player]: All good. I'm in the hab.
