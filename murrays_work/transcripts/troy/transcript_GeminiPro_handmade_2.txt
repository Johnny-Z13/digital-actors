[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

[Odysseus]: A king's plea, and the whisper of fate. 

[Achilles]: Fate whispers to us all, Odysseus, but I am not a man to be swayed by whispers. 

[Odysseus]: But the roar of glory, Achilles, that's a sound you cannot ignore. 

[Achilles]: Glory is a fickle mistress, Odysseus, easily bought and quickly forgotten. 

[Odysseus]: Not the glory etched in Trojan blood, Achilles, the glory that will echo through eternity. 

[Achilles]: Let Trojan blood water their own fields. I'll spill no tears for their lost glory. 

[Odysseus]: And yet, I see the fire of battle still burns in your eyes, Achilles. 

[Achilles]: **It's a fire Agamemnon has grown accustomed to using for his own warmth, Odysseus.** 

[Odysseus]: **And what of Patroclus' warmth, Achilles? Will he freeze in your shadow?** 

**[Achilles]:  Patroclus's fate is his own to forge. He's a man, not a boy in need of a nursemaid.** 

**[Odysseus]: And what of the poets, Achilles? Will they sing of a man who shuns the heat of the forge for the chill of the shadows?** 

**[Achilles]: Let them sing of heroes who crave the praise of minstrels more than the clang of steel on steel.** 

**[Odysseus]:  Is that what you crave then, Achilles? The deafening silence of forgotten battles?** 

**[Achilles]: Some silences speak louder than the clash of a thousand armies, Odysseus.  ** 

**[Odysseus]:  And what will you say when history asks why those armies marched without their greatest warrior?** 

**[Achilles]: Let history write what it will. I'll be too busy living it to notice.** 

**[Odysseus]:  A life lived in the shadows is barely a life at all, Achilles.** 

**[Achilles]: Better to rule in the shadows than serve in the light, Odysseus.** 

**[Odysseus]:  Even a king can be blinded by too much light, Achilles. **
