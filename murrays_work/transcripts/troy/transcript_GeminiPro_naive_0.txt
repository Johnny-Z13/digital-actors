[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

Odysseus: To watch a legend at work, perhaps? 

Achilles: Flattery will get you nowhere, old friend. 

Odysseus:  Perhaps not. But neither will sulking in this crumbling temple. 

Achilles:  And who are you to judge where Achilles chooses to spend his days? 

Odysseus: A fellow warrior, come to offer counsel...and perhaps a challenge. 

Achilles:  A challenge? You think you can best me, Odysseus? Don't mistake me for one of your sparring partners from Ithaca. 

Odysseus:  With swords? Never. But there are other contests, old friend. Battles beyond the reach of blades. 

Achilles:  Are you suggesting I've grown soft, Odysseus? That my mind is as dull as a rusty blade? 

Odysseus:  Gods, no! Your mind is a weapon sharper than any spear. But even the sharpest blade can be wasted on a unworthy opponent. 

Achilles:  And what opponent do you suggest would be worthy of my time, Odysseus?

Odysseus: What about Hector?  

Achilles:  Hector?  That Trojan pup? 

Odysseus:  He is the finest warrior Troy has to offer. Don't you think he's worthy of your steel? 

Achilles:  He's half the warrior I am. What glory is there in crushing an ant?  

Odysseus:  Perhaps. But what if the ant stands between you and immortal glory, Achilles? 

Achilles:  Immortal glory, you say? 

Odysseus: The likes of which the world has never seen. 

Achilles: And what makes you think this Trojan squabble is the path to such glory? 

Odysseus:  Because, dear Achilles, Troy is no mere city.
