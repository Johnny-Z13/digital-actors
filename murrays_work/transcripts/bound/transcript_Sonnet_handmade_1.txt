[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

[Corky]: Oh, right. Yeah, I remember. What can I do for you?
[Violet]: I thought I'd bring you a cup of coffee, welcome you to the building. I hope you like it strong.
[Corky]: Thanks, that's real nice of you. I do like my coffee strong, just like I like my... tools.
[Violet]: Speaking of tools, I couldn't help but notice the noise this morning. You certainly know how to handle those power tools, don't you?
[Corky]: Oh, sorry about that. I'll try to keep it down in the mornings. Didn't mean to wake the whole building.
[Violet]: Oh, don't worry too much. I'm actually an early riser. I'm just... impressed. A woman who's so handy with tools. What exactly are you working on in there?
[Corky]: Just doing some renovations. Putting up some shelves, fixing a few things here and there. Nothing too fancy, but it keeps me busy.
[Violet]: Renovations? How fascinating. I've always admired people who can work with their hands. Say, what kind of vehicle does a handy woman like yourself drive? Let me guess... a sporty convertible?
[Corky]: Ha! Not quite. I'm more practical than flashy. I drive a truck. Gets the job done, carries all my tools.
