## INT. BRIDGE OF THE PROSPERO - NIGHT

The bridge goes dark, sirens blare, red warning lights flash. The Prospero is going down fast. A voice calls out from the distress radio.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(calm, direct)* Deep sea crisis officer patching in. Please receive.

*(beat)*
*(more forceful)* I repeat: Available crew please pick up. Crisis officer patching in. You're falling fast, prospero, I'm here to help.

---

### PLAYER PICKS UP.

**PLAYER**
Hi, I'm here.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(relief)* There you are!
*(reassuring)* You're in quite the mess down there but you're in good hands, I've survived worse. *(formal)* The name's Lt. James Kovich. Retired. So I suppose I can drop rank. Just call me James. What's your name?

**PLAYER**
Megan

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(warm)* Pleasure to meet you, [player name]. *(confident)* I had a feeling you weren't the captain. *(judging)* I knew him from the navy, liked a drink.
*(direct)* Ok, well, we need to stabilise fast before the old girl hits the bed.
*(direct)* Can you work with me, [player name]?

**PLAYER**
I can do that. Although I may have had a drink.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(genuine)* I appreciate the honesty.
*(dryly)* But let's assume you're the most sober mind on the bridge.
*(reassuring)* We'll keep it simple.

---

## PHASE 1 - TRUST

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(calm)* Ok, power has taken a hit but the emergency generator will have kicked in. That's why it's still shouting for your attention, and when systems speak we listen. There will be a lit panel, probably blinking erratically. *(fatherly)* Can you find it for me?

**DIALOGUE WHILE PLAYER LOCATES PANEL.**

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(inquisitive)* I have a habit of not liking when things go quiet. My wife will say it's how I manage fear in others. *(curious)* What do you do when things go quiet?

**PLAYER**
Talk too much probably.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(warm)* At least we won't have any dead airwaves then. We'll keep each other occupied. *(serious)* Silence can be a killer.

---

### Player finds the panel.

**PLAYER**
I've found it.

*The panel lights flash erratically. Dials spin out. Numbers dropping and rising without reason.*

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(happy)* Good work. Ignore the numbers for now. There should be a hefty looking leaver on the panel. If it's down, push it up. Confirm once complete.

*Player pushes leaver and the alarms begin to subside. Lights come back on: power restored.*

**PLAYER**
That worked.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(calm, relaxed)* There we go. She's settling. *(focused)* How are those numbers looking?

**PLAYER**
They've stopped going crazy.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(relaxed)* Good. If the numbers are steady, we're steady.
*(serious)* Systems don't lie. Usually they're the only things you can trust down here.
*(dryly)* People on the other hand. *(beat)*
*(curious)* Speaking of people. *(concern)* Not to pry, but are you often on your own?

**PLAYER**
I have lots of friends. Maybe I just don't like the crew.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(chuckling)* I see.. You like people. Just not all people. I can relate to that.
*(focused)* Right, [player name], we're not out of the woods yet.

---

### END OF PHASE 1

**Character notes:**
- James is calm, confident and reassuring
- Light small talk to keep player calm. Nothing too emotionally deep. There is a crisis to solve.
- He doesn't talk of danger, fear or sacrifice
- The player should feel safe and capable

---

## PHASE 2: WORKING TOGETHER

**Story beat:** The power is brought back online. James is congratulatory and warm, his personality comes through. The job is not yet done, the ship needs to be brought back into an upward trajectory.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(focused)* We need to stabilise a course to the surface. Get to the helm.

*Player at helm.*

**PLAYER**
Ok what do I do now.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
Check autopilot locks. They'll be a switch to engage manually.

**PLAYER**
Done it.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(happy)* Fantastic.
*(supportive)* Take control. Easy now.

*Player takes control.*

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(excited)* Good. Pull her up. Don't hesitate. Be forceful. Be confident.
*(warm)* We know where to go, you just need to tell her. Hesitation in a crisis is a death wish.

*The player directs the ship.*

**DIALOGUE WHILE SUB STABILISES. A brief moment while the alarms are stopped. James will tell an anecdote from their navy days. One that encapsulates the core belief about hesitation.**

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio) *(con't)*
*(proud)* You're flying now! Not too shabby, I must say. *(fatherly)* How does it feel?

**PLAYER**
Pretty cool, I guess. I've played flying games before though.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio) *(con't)*
*(thoughtful)* You know maybe viewing these things as a game is a good way of surviving them. *(direct)* I've seen people in tight spots. Some freeze. Others act. *(curious)* Which one are you?

**PLAYER**
Are there only two options?

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(humoured)* Perhaps for a rigid old navy man, yes.

**PLAYER**
You're not that old, are you?

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(straight)* Old enough to have gone through training over two decades ago.

*(stoic)* I thought my training prepared me for action back then. *(honest)* Then I became a parent and somehow unlearnt it all…
*(warm)* I remember my boy got hit by a swing at the park once. Took a bang to the head. I was calm. Waited.

*(proud)* My wife on the other hand rushed in and got him seen to. *(serious)* He was fine, of course. But you can't wait to find out.

*(chuckle)* I always told him never to stand in front of the swings… *(proud)* Alex always made his own choices.

**PLAYER**
Where's Alex now?

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
On a sub somewhere worrying his mother.

---

## PHASE 3: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE

**Story beat:** Without warning the ship takes a nose dive. James shifts from reassurance to focus. The system offers a solution: Flood the machinery bay to stabilise the vessel.

**PROSPERO SHIP SYSTEM ANNOUNCEMENT:** Prospero completely screwed. Machinery bay flooding required.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(focused)* Alright, new problem.
*(direct)* Before we flood anything, we check occupancy.
*(authoritative)* See what you can find on the bridge.

**PLAYER**
What am I looking for?

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(calm)* Logs. Rotas. Files. Evidence. Put your trust in procedure.

*(proud)* If there's anyone down there, it was by choice. People take work like that because they believe in it. They know the risks and go in anyway.

**DIALOGUE WHILE SUB STABILISES**
*I want to invite the player to notice cracks in James. He should be more focused here, erring on controlling.*

**PLAYER**
Is that why you joined the navy?

**JAMES KOVICH** (over the radio)
*(blunt)* Family trade. *(honest)* But, yes, I guess such things are inherited. *(deflecting)* I'm sure you've inherited things from your parents, whether you like them or not?

**PLAYER**
I guess. The annoying bits.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over the radio)
*(chuckle)* My son would say the same no doubt.

*Player still searching*

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(slightly strained)* Have you found anything?
*(rushing)* Logs. Paperwork. Sticky notes. Check everything and anything.

**PLAYER**
You alright? You sound off?

**JAMES KOVICH**
*(abrupt)* I'm fine. *(reassuring)* I, I just want you to focus.

---

### Player finds an engineer rota: First responder - Engineer - Machinery bay

**PLAYER**
Someone may have entered the machine bay in the emergency, it says a first responder will always do that?

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(concern)* Ok.
*(beat)*
*(focused)* The machine bay is directly below you.
*(urgent)* We need to know if they're in there.

*Stairwell to the machinery bay entrance is flooded.*

**PLAYER**
I can't get down there. The stairs are flooded.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(strained)* Damn it.
*(composed)* Ok, ok…There'll be a pipe and valve nearby. Drain it.

**PLAYER FINDS CORRECT VALVE**

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(direct)* Is it working?

**PLAYER**
Yep.

**DIALOGUE while the player is turning the valve and the water is draining.**

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(concerned)* If an engineer is down there. They'll know that the bay may need to be flooded.

**PLAYER**
Are you worried?

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(composing)* No. I'm just… Talking. *(serious)* They know what they signed up for. *(thoughtful)* There are others on board.

*Water is drained and the player accesses the entrance way to machinery.*

**PLAYER**
It's draining.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
You bloody hero!

---

## PHASE 4: REVELATION

**Story beat:** At the machine area door are entry logs: James's son Alex Kovich is revealed to be in the machinery bay below. James absorbs the shock. He acts fast, the first sense of personal panic slipping through.

*Player access the door log. The engineer is still inside. The name of the lead engine is Alex Kovich.*

**PLAYER**
Someone's in there. Their name is Alex Kovich. Isn't that your son?

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(beat)*
*(plainly)* Yes. That's my son.
*(annoyed, urgent)* Now get the damn door open.

**PLAYER**
Why didn't you say anything?

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(direct)* Because it doesn't change anything. Try the door. *(beat)*

*Player tries to open the door. It's locked.*

**PLAYER**
It's locked. I'm sorry.

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(strained)* No apologies.
*(calm, forceful)* Shout for him.
*(factual)* Oxygen levels may have dropped.
*(strained)* Or… he may have banged his head in the collision.

**PLAYER**
Alex?! Alex?!

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(resigned)* He can't hear you.

*James goes silent.*

---

## PHASE 5: GRIEF SPIRAL

**Story beat:** Alarms start again, the ship announces that a fire has ripped through another part of the ship, oxygen is running out, the bridge is beginning to flood. If the lack of oxygen doesn't kill everyone (including you), the rising water will.

**PROSPERO SHIP SYSTEM ANNOUNCEMENT:** IMPACT IMMINENT. FLOOD MACHINE BAY. MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED. COUNTDOWN STARTED.

---

### [SUCCESS PATH]

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(quiet)* The system's right. You have to flood it now. *(distant)* Or no one will make it.

**PLAYER**
You need to tell me how.

---

### [DENIAL]

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(James is quiet on the line a moment, distracted, stuttering)*
*(denial)* It might not be him…

**PLAYER**
James I need you to tell me how to do it! Quickly!

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio) *[denial]*
*(denial)* The log might be wrong..

**PLAYER**
*[player refers to trusting the system]*
You said we have to trust the system. That's what you believe.

---

### [BARGAINING]

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(stressed)* I know. I just need, I just need a moment.

**PLAYER**
*[player refers to the dangers of hesitation]*
We don't have a moment. We can't hesitate. Hesitation is dangerous.

---

### [GUILT]

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(spiralling)* He's in there because of me. Because of who I am…

**PLAYER**
*[player refers to who Alex is]*
*(despairing)* He chose this. He's here because of who he is. You told me that. Alex always makes his own choices.

*(beat)*

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(accepting)* And I must respect them…
*(pained)* Upstairs. Quickly. *(James explains how to flood machinery)*

---

### RESOLUTION

*James is quiet now. No filler. No chat. If the player speaks he answers simply. Only to the effect of what needs to be instructed to flood machinery.*

*The player follows James' orders: machinery is flooded…*

**JAMES KOVICH** (over radio)
*(heartfelt)* Goodbye, Alex.
*(stoic)* I am proud of your service…

*The sub rights itself. Water stops rising. Alarms stop whirring.*

---

**FADE TO BLACK.**
