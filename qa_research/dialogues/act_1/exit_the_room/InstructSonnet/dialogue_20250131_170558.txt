Eliza: Great. Once you're close, ask Luna to open the door. Make sure you switched gravity back on before that, though.
Player: Luna, gravity on.
Eliza: Excellent. Now that gravity's on, you should be able to stand. Can you see the door clearly? Remember to say "Luna, open door" when you're ready.
Player: Luna, open door.
Eliza: Did the door open? If not, I might need to try something else. Let me know what's happening on your end.
Player: The door didn't open. Luna said "Access Denied" when I tried to open it.
Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID
Eliza: I see. We'll have to try a different approach then. I know a way to bypass the system, but I'll need you to help me. Can you scan the door and tell me the ID number you see? It should be a sequence of two letters followed by three digits. Just the three digits will do.
Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID
Player: Luna, scan. The door ID is LM-023. So the three digits are 023.
Computer: CORRECT DOOR ID
Eliza: Excellent, I've got it. I'm overriding the system now... and... there we go. The door should be opening. Can you confirm it's working on your end?
