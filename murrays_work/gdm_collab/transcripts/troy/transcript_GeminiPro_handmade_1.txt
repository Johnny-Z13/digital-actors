[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

[Odysseus]: A king in need and an army without its sharpest spear. 

[Achilles]: My spear remains untested, Odysseus, and I see no reason to bloody it on Agamemnon's behalf. 

[Odysseus]:  Is the battlefield not a more fitting stage for your talents than these tents, Achilles? 

[Achilles]: My talents are my own, Odysseus, not Agamemnon's to wield. 

[Odysseus]:  Even heroes need a cause, Achilles, and what greater cause than the defense of Greece and the rescue of Helen? 

[Achilles]: **Let Menelaus fight for his own wife.  He seems to have had no trouble stealing her away the first time.** 

[Odysseus]: **Sharp words, Achilles, but they won't deflect the gaze of history. Will you truly let this war be won and sung without your name in the verses?** 

[Achilles]: **Let the poets sing of kings and their stolen wives.  I'll write my own legend, Odysseus.** 

**[Odysseus]:  And what legend will that be, Achilles? A tale whispered in empty tents?** 

**[Achilles]: Better a whisper in an empty tent than a chorus in a fool's court.** 

**[Odysseus]:  Is Agamemnon's court the only one you deem foolish, or do you hold us all in such low regard?** 

**[Achilles]:  Low enough to know when I'm being used, Odysseus.  And I won't be made a pawn in Agamemnon's game.** 

**[Odysseus]: Even a pawn can become a queen, Achilles, given the right moves.** 

**[Achilles]: And who decides these moves, Odysseus? You? Or the king who hides behind his soldiers?** 

**[Odysseus]:  The gods decide the fate of us all, Achilles, but we choose the path we walk to meet it.** 

**[Achilles]:  Then let Agamemnon choose his path, and I'll choose mine.** 

**[Odysseus]:  And is that path not alongside your kin, beside your own blood, Patroclus?** 

**[Achilles]: Don't presume to know my heart, Odysseus, or the bonds I keep.** 

**[Odysseus]: A bond unspoken is a promise unkept, Achilles.  Think carefully before the silence speaks for you.**
