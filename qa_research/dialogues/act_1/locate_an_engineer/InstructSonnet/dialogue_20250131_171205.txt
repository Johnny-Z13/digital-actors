Eliza: So your pod id tells me you're a zoologist. That might be helpful for our terraforming mission, but with the fleet malfunctioning you need to find a bona fide engineer.
Eliza: Activating your eye-OS implant so you can scan the room for an engineer in stasis. Hang on, this won't take long.
Eliza: Did it work? You should be seeing a sort of advanced visual interface.
Player: Yeah, I see it. There's a bunch of information overlaid on everything now. It's like I'm in some kind of high-tech video game.
Eliza: That's good to hear. Now, to activate the scanning function, just say "Luna Scan" out loud. Luna's our ship's AI assistant, and she'll help you identify the pods and their occupants.
Player: Alright, here goes nothing. Luna Scan.
Eliza: Perfect. You should now see information about each pod and its occupant. Look around for someone with "Engineer" listed as their occupation. Let me know when you find one.
Player: I see an engineer here. His name is John Lusty. Should I give you his pod ID?
Computer: WRONG ID
Eliza: Yes, please. Read out the pod ID for John Lusty. We'll need that to wake him up remotely.
Computer: WRONG ID
Player: The pod ID for John Lusty is ED 3122.
Computer: ENGINEER ID
Eliza: Great, I've got it. I'm initiating the wake-up sequence for pod ED 3122 now. It'll take a few moments, but... wait, something's not right. I'm getting warning signals. Can you tell me what you're seeing at the pod?
Player: I'm seeing an error message on the pod's display, and... oh no, there's fire! The pod is on fire!
