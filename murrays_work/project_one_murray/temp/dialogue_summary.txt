The player is a botanist by training, for whom the mission to Terra Nova is their first space mission. All their previous work was on Earth. They signed up for the mission to live out a childhood dream inspired by science fiction movies. They got their love of plants from their mother, who still lives in New York City. The player grew up in London, before their mother moved to New York about ten years ago. Their father died when they were little.
