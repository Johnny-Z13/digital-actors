[Eliza]: Okay, I see you’re finally outside.  Now you just need to find the Hab.  Can you see a ... a thing that looks like a big, a big bubble?

[Player]: I can. I guess that's the Bio Hab.

[Eliza]: That's right, that's your destination. Now, just take it slow and steady. How are you feeling out there? My Papa always said spacewalks felt like constantly falling.

[Player]: I'm doing fine. I've only ever done a couple of space walks before. It feels lonely, but sort of in a good way. How come your father knew about space walks?

[Eliza]: Oh, my Papa worked for Fix Force back in the day. He was always out there, fixing things on the outside of ships. He used to tell me stories about it when I was little. It's funny, I never found space beautiful like some people do. To me, it's just... outside. Cold and empty.

[Player]: I do find it beautiful, in a way. It makes me reflect on my whole life sometimes.

[Eliza]: That's an interesting perspective. I guess beauty can be found even in emptiness. Oh, by the way, what color is your suit? I just remembered something important about the suits.

[Player]: Never mind that, Eliza. I want to hear more about your father.

[Eliza]: My father? Well, he was... complicated. Brilliant engineer, but not always the best at being a dad. He loved his work so much, sometimes I felt like I was competing with the vastness of space for his attention. But when he was present, he could make even the most technical stuff sound like magic. What about your family? Did they influence your view of space?

[Player]: I never knew my father. He died in an accident just after I was born. My mother was always sad, I felt.

[Eliza]: I'm sorry to hear that. It's funny how our parents shape our views, even when they're not there. Maybe that's why you find beauty in the emptiness of space - it's a way of connecting with something bigger than yourself. But listen, I really need to know about your suit color. It's important for your safety.

[Player]: Oh, the suit. Yes, it's a blue one.

[Eliza]: Blue? Oh no... Okay, don't panic, but those blue suits have had some issues with temperature regulation. Some people have... well, let's just say it's important you get to the Hab quickly. How close are you now?

[Player]: I'm pretty close. What issues though? You're making me nervous.

[Eliza]: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. It's just... there have been incidents where people in blue suits experienced severe cold during extended spacewalks. But you're almost there, and this is a short trip. Just keep moving steadily towards the Hab. You're doing great, and I'm right here with you. Can you see the airlock entrance yet?

[Player]: That whole loneliness of space thing takes on a whole new dimension when you're facing death. But I'm not feeling cold. Nearly there.

[Eliza]: That's a relief to hear. And you're right, the threat of danger does change how we perceive things. But let's focus on the positive - you're almost there, and you're handling this like a pro. Keep your eyes on that airlock, it's your ticket to safety. Remember, slow and steady movements. How's your breathing?

[Player]: Don't worry. I'm there now.
