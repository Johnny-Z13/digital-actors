    "Duke Leto: So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?",
    "Kynes: (turning to Gurney) I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.",
    "Duke Leto: This is my son, Paul.",
    "Paul: Are you a Fremen?",
    "Kynes: I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.",
    "Paul: (inner voice) He's hiding something.",
    "Duke Leto: I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.",
    "Kynes: They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.",
    "Paul: \"Your gift is a blessing of the river.\" Kynes' Fremen Guards, hearing this are siezed with agitation. Kynes quites them, then studies Paul.",
    "Kynes: (inner voice) The Mahdi will greet you with holy words and your gifts will be a blessing. (spoken, nonchalantly) Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. They mean no harm. With your permission, I will check the security of your suits. Gurney and the guard move forward warily.",
    "Gurney: (angrily) The Duke is to be addresses as...",
    "Narrator: --",
    "Gurney: checking seals and pulling on straps.",
    "Kynes: Basically...",
    "Gurney: (leaping forward to protect his Duke) Sire!",
    "Duke Leto: It's all right Gurney. Gurney steps back.",
    "Gurney: Yes, Sire.",
    "Kynes: It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.",
    "Narrator: The Duke is now properly fitted. Kynes places the noseplug into his nose.",
    "Kynes: With a Fremen suit in good working order, one can sustain life for weeks, even in the deep desert. He removes the noseplug.",
    "Duke Leto: My thanks.",
    "Kynes: With your permission... Kynes turns to Paul, running his hands over the slick fabric. He stands back with a puzzled expression.",
    "Narrator: --",
    "Kynes: You've worn a stillsuit before?",
    "Paul: No.",
    "Kynes: Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?",
    "Paul: No one. It... seemed the proper way.",
    "Kynes: That it is. (inner voice) He shall know your ways as if born to them.",
    "Narrator: Kyne's Fremen guard are watching Paul very closely now.",
    "Gurney: We're wasting time, Sire. Duke Leto, Dr. Kynes, Gurney and Paul enter the ornithopter... Jessica trembles.",
    "Jessica: (inner voice) I must speak with you Leto!"
