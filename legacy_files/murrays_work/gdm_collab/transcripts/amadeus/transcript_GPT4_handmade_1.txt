[Mozart]: We have guests!

[Schikaneder]: Ah, my dear Wolfie, and what a splendid gathering it is!
[Mozart]: A gathering worthy of the gods themselves! Wine, women, and song to fill our night with endless delight!
[Schikaneder]: And perhaps a few mischiefs, eh? Tonight, my friend, we shall make Bacchus himself envious!
[Mozart]: Indeed, Schikaneder! Let the heavens quiver at our laughter and the moon blush at our antics!
[Schikaneder]: And let not a single sober soul escape our merry clutches! To revelry and ribaldry, my dear Wolfie!
[Constanze]: Wolfie, I need to talk to you, it's important.
[Mozart]: Not now, dear Constanze! Can't you see we're in the midst of making history with our merrymaking?
[Constanze]: Wolfie, please, this cannot wait.
[Mozart]: Oh, my sweet Constanze, always so serious! Join us, and your worries will dissolve like sugar in wine!
[Constanze]: Wolfie, it's about your father—please, you must listen to me.
[Mozart]: My father? Oh, surely old Leopold can wait until tomorrow, my love! Tonight, we are free spirits!
[Constanze]: No, Wolfie, you don't understand—your father, he's passed away.
