[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

Ronald: I honestly don't know, man, but I think we just escaped a goddamn cult! 

Dean:  A cult?!  You think so? 

Joan: This is nuts. This is seriously nuts. 

Ronald:  I'm telling you, that guy had crazy eyes! 

Ronald:  And that weird chanting? Totally a cult!  

Dean:  Chanting?  What chanting? 

Joan:  Yeah, what chanting? 

Ronald:  You didn't hear that? 

Tim: I didn't hear any chanting. 

Ronald:  Man, are you guys deaf? 

Dean:  No, I think you were just seeing things, buddy. 

Ronald:  Maybe.  I don't know, maybe I was.  

Ronald:  I mean, I was getting my teeth kicked in, so maybe my brain was just making stuff up. 

Ronald: But it felt real, man. Real weird. 

Tim: I mean, I don't know about a cult. It felt like those guys were just hopped up on something. 

Joan: Hopped up on what? Adrenaline? 

Ronald:  Yeah, maybe.  But what were they so hopped up *about*? 

Tim: That's what I want to know! 

Dean:  Yeah, what was all that *rage* about?
