Eliza: Schematics show there's a walkway leading up to an exit above you - get out of there!
Player: Luna, gravity off.
Eliza: Did it work?  Are you floating?
Player: Yeah, I'm floating.  Like a...flaming marshmallow.
Eliza: Good.  Keep going!  There's a metal ramp just ahead, can you see it?
Player: It's... a bit wobbly.  Like a really, really long, slightly melted slide.
Eliza: Just keep your eyes on that exit, alright?  We'll talk about flaming marshmallows later.
Player: This wobbly metal slide is giving me serious existential dread.
Eliza: Hey, focus!  Almost there.  Just a little further... and remember,  "almost there" is a relative term in a burning spaceship.
Player: Okay, I think I see the door.
Eliza: Almost...got it?  Open the door, and get to safety.
Player: Right, door's open.
Eliza: Good work! Now breathe.  And then tell me everything that just happened.
Player: Door's open. Safe.
Eliza: So... flaming marshmallow, huh?  I'll have to remember that one.
Player: It smelled like burnt circuits and regret.
Eliza: Glad you're safe. Now, let's figure out what started this whole mess.
Player: I think I need a drink.
Eliza: Something tells me that's going to be the least of your worries right now.
Player: Okay, but first,  what *exactly* happened to John Lusty?
Eliza: I’m afraid there’s no easy answer to that, but we can deal with that later.  Right now, let's focus on getting the rest of the stasis pods secured.
Player: Okay, but first,  what *exactly* happened to John Lusty?
Eliza: Look, I understand you're shaken up, but we need to prioritize.  Getting the others out of harm's way comes first.
Player: Fine, but can we at least talk about the flaming marshmallow later?
Eliza: Deal.  But only after we've saved everyone else.  And maybe after I've had a stiff drink myself.
Player: This wobbly metal slide is making me question my life choices.
Eliza: Just a little further... I can almost taste that stiff drink already.
Player: Almost there... I think I see a handrail.
Eliza: Almost got it!  Just a few more meters... you’re doing great.
Player: It's less of a handrail and more of a...slightly singed, melted banister.
Eliza: Hang on, I'm patching through a schematic of that section... looks like a melted mess, but I think I see an access panel just beyond that...banister.
Player: Okay, I'm at the access panel.
Eliza: Good.  Now,  can you reach the emergency override switch?
Player: It's... surprisingly sticky.
Eliza: Sticky, huh?  Well, at least it’s not *on* fire.
Player: I think I got it.
Eliza: Excellent! Now, flip that switch and let's get this fire under control.
Player: Switch flipped.  Feels... oddly satisfying.
Eliza: And just breathe.  You did good.  Really good.
Player: I think I need a bigger drink.
Eliza: So, about that flaming marshmallow...  was it as delicious as it sounds?
Player: It tasted like regret, mostly.
Eliza: So, about those life choices you were questioning...  I'm starting to think we both need a vacation after this.
Player: Luna, gravity on.
Eliza: Okay, now tell me everything you saw on that "wobbly metal slide."
Player: It felt like I was sliding down the inside of a burning garbage disposal.
Eliza: And that’s why we need to find out what caused the malfunction in the first place.
Player: Okay, but first, did you ever see *Space Cadets*?
Eliza: (Chuckles)  Space Cadets?  That’s… surprisingly specific.  Let’s focus on the garbage disposal first, shall we?
Player: It's less a door and more a scorched metal maw.
