[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

[Dean]:  Holy shit, Ronald, I thought you were a goner! 

[Ronald] (Chuckles)  Nah, man,  a brother's got skills. 

[Joan]: Skills?  I thought you were about to wet yourself! 

[Ronald]:  Joan, baby, that's what we call "method acting."  

[Dean]: Method acting?  Shit, I thought they were gonna method act your ass six feet under! 

[Tim]:  Method acting? You mean...you weren't *really* packin' heat? 

[Ronald]:  Tim, my man, a true playa never reveals his hand. 

[Dean]: So you're sayin' you bluffed your way outta there? Damn, Ronald, you ain't the dude I thought you were! 

[Ronald]:  Yo, Dean-o-mite, there's more to this brother than meets the eye. 

[Tim]:  So, like, you were *acting*  just now? All that "Yo, Dean-o-mite" stuff? 

[Ronald]:  Man, you think *this* is an act?  This is how I talk on Tuesdays! 

[Joan]: Tuesdays, huh?  You're weirder than I thought. 

[Dean]:  Weirder’s an understatement. That was some straight-up Shaft shit back there! 

[Tim]: Shaft?  Isn't that, like, a movie from the seventies? 

[Ronald]:  Man, you're showing your age!  Blaxploitation's never out of style. 

[Dean]: Blaxploitation?  Shit, I thought that was just what you called insurance these days! 

[Joan]: You two are terrible.  Someone tell me this night gets less strange. 

[Tim]:  I don't think that's how "strange" works... 

[Ronald]:  Oh, it gets stranger, trust me.  Way stranger.
