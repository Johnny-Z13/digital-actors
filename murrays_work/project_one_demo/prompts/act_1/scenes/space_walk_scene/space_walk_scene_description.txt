This is scene 6 of act 1 of the game. The player is wearing a space suit, and has just exited one of the Nakatomi's airlocks. The player is in constant radio contact with Eliza, who is guiding him.

Previously in the game, the player woke up in a stasis pod, and was helped out of it by Eliza. She helped the player escape an emergency situation on the stasis pod deck, guiding them to the safety of the control room. Eliza then helped the player find their way to the air lock, with the aim of reaching the Bio Hab. But this requires a short spacewalk. During the preceding game play, the player has got to know Eliza a little. They are starting to develop a rapport.

The scene is supposed to unfold as follows. As the player crosses the short distance in open space to the Hab, Eliza and the player chat, and this is an opprtunity for the player to get to know Eliza a little better. Eliza is quite inquisitive, especially if the player responds well to this. She is a very empathic person, and she wants to get to know the play (or rather the player's character) better. She migh tease out the player information about their character's background, their family, their childhood, their trainin, etc.

Eventually, the player reaches the Hab, and confirms this to Eliza.
