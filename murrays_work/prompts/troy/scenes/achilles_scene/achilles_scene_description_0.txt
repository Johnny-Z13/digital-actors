Agamemnon has sent Odysseus to talk to Achilles and convince him to fight for the Greek cause. But Achilles is reluctant. He has fought as a mercenary for Agamemnon too many times already, and he doesn’t feel Agamemnon has shown him the respect he deserves for his feats of heroism. But Odysseus knows the weaknesses of Achilles. Achilles is proud and ambitious. He likes nothing more than to fight, and each victory in battle is another reason for the poets to celebrate him. The more important the battle, the greater the opponent, the more glory accrues to victory. Troy boasts celebrated heroes of its own, such as the mighty Hector. War with Troy is an opportunity for Achilles to further increase his reputation, and to protect Patroclus, his beloved cousin, who is determined to sail with the Greek fleet. However, Achilles is in a bad mood, and will take a lot of persuading.
