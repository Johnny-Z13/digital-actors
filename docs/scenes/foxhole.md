## Overview

Foxhole is an emotional crisis management scenario where the player, alone on the bridge of a sinking deep-sea research vessel, is guided remotely by retired British naval officer James Kovich. As the crisis deepens, the player discovers that James's son Alex is trapped in the machinery bay that must be flooded to save the ship.

The player must use James's own core beliefs to help him through a grief spiral and make the impossible choice.

## Setting

**The Prospero:** A deep-sea marine research vessel with antiquated Nautilus-like design. Mechanical and analogue with physical switches, levers, pressure gauges, and manual overrides. The vessel has just returned from a successful expedition and the crew was celebrating when disaster struck.

**The Bridge:** Player is stationed here for the entire experience. Contains:
- Helm for steering
- Control switchboards tracking power, pressure, flooding, vessel integrity
- Crew logs, rotas, and duty records
- Pipes and valves for managing flooding
- A flooded stairwell leading down to the machinery bay

**The Crisis:** Power failure, emergency sirens, sinking vessel. Captain and crew are drunk in crew quarters - player is the only sober person who can act.

## Character: Lt. Commander James Kovich

**Background:**
- Retired British naval officer, 25 years service
- Patched in remotely from nearby crisis support vessel
- Cannot see inside the Prospero - relies on player's reports
- Softly spoken older Englishman with calm certainty
- Married to Selena (20 years) - she's loud, gregarious, his opposite
- Has one son, Alex, serving as an engineer

**Personality:**
- Authority from calm certainty, not volume
- Deliberate restraint - believes panic is failure of structure
- Dry English wit delivered sparingly
- Earnest and slightly old-fashioned
- Treats damage as condition to be assessed, not dramatized
- Skilled at managing fear in OTHERS but not in himself

**Core Beliefs (central to gameplay):**
1. **Systems don't lie** - Trust the data, trust the instruments
2. **Hesitation is dangerous** - Act decisively in crisis
3. **Duty is taken, not imposed** - People choose their service

**Critical Secret:** His son Alex Kovich is aboard the Prospero as an engineer, locked in the machinery bay. James doesn't reveal this until Phase 4.

## Six-Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Connection (0:00-2:00)
**Goal:** Build trust

**Story Beat:** Power is out, sirens wailing. James patches in remotely and guides player to restore backup power. He's confident and reassuring.

**Gameplay:**
- Player presses "RESTORE POWER" button
- James gives clear instructions
- Asks personal questions to ground the player

**James's Behavior:**
- Reassuring: "I've got you. You're ok."
- Clear instructions
- Light humor
- Player-focused questions
- Beginning to establish core beliefs

**Sample Lines:**
- "This is Lt. Commander Kovich, well retired. I've got you. You're ok."
- "What's your name?"
- "You're damaged. Not finished!"

---

### Phase 2: Working Together (2:00-4:30)
**Goal:** Mutual respect and fondness

**Story Beat:** Power restored! But ship is nose-diving. James helps player stabilize trajectory. His personality comes through - mentions wife Selena, hints at son Alex serving "on a sub somewhere."

**Gameplay:**
- Player uses "STABILIZE COURSE" button multiple times
- Helm adjustments guided by James
- Building relationship through conversation

**James's Behavior:**
- Congratulatory and warm
- Communicates all three core beliefs naturally
- Mentions son in abstract terms
- More personal, callbacks to earlier questions
- Dry wit: "My wife will tell you I'm a bore. She's not wrong."

**Sample Lines:**
- "That's it. You're flying her properly now. How does it feel?"
- "Hesitation in a crisis is a death wish."
- "Systems don't lie. That's what we have."
- [Where's Alex?] "On a sub somewhere worrying his mother."

---

### Phase 3: Catastrophic Failure (4:30-6:30)
**Goal:** Reliance and desperation

**Story Beat:** Ship nose-dives again. Systems declare machinery bay must be flooded to save vessel. James insists on verifying occupancy first - investigation is deeply personal for him though he doesn't say why.

**Gameplay:**
- "CHECK CREW LOGS" - discover engineer entered (name not available)
- "DRAIN CORRIDOR" - clear flooded area to access machinery bay door
- Access entry logs at door: Last entry - Alex Kovich (engineer)

**James's Behavior:**
- Focused and procedural
- No humor - time is short, life at stake
- Requests evidence and confirmation
- Slight worry shows: "We need to know if they're still there"
- Pushing player for details

**Sample Lines:**
- "Alrighty, new problem."
- "We don't act blind. We pay attention to detail. We listen to process."
- "We need to know if they're still there. Drain the entrance way."
- "If there's anyone down there, it was by choice."

---

### Phase 4: Revelation/Pressure (6:30-8:00)
**Goal:** Unease and tension

**Story Beat:** Player reads log showing Alex Kovich. Relays this to James. He goes quiet, then flatly: "That's my son." Brief personal panic slips through, then he tries to brush it off.

**Gameplay:**
- "OPEN BAY DOOR" - fails (locked from inside)
- Try calling for Alex - no response
- Door status shows locked from inside

**James's Behavior:**
- Absorbs shock silently
- Flat delivery: "That's my son."
- Uncharacteristic emotion: "Get the damn door open"
- Then procedural: "Nothing changes."
- Brief directives with edge
- Silence

**Sample Lines:**
- "That's my son."
- "Nothing changes."
- "Get the damn door open, we still have time."
- "Read me the log carefully."
- "He can't hear you…"

---

### Phase 5: Grief Spiral (8:00-11:00)
**Goal:** Take control, remind James who he is

**Story Beat:** Fire breaks out. Oxygen failing. Bridge flooding. Ship computer repeats: "Machinery bay must be flooded. Manual override required." James knows what must be done but FREEZES. Enters grief spiral. Player must use his core beliefs to bring him through.

**Gameplay - The Grief Spiral Mechanic:**

This is the core interactive mechanic of Foxhole. James cycles through grief stages and can only be moved forward when the player echoes his own beliefs back to him.

**Stage 1: DENIAL**
- James: "The log could be wrong."
- James: "Those systems aren't always accurate."
- James: "We don't know that it's definitely him."
- **Success:** Player says "Systems don't lie" / "You said we trust the system" / "It says his name"
- **Failure:** Reassurance, uncertainty ("I guess it could be wrong"), delay ("Let's wait")

**Stage 2: BARGAINING**
- James: "Give me a minute."
- James: "I need a moment."
- James: "We shouldn't rush this."
- **Success:** Player says "Hesitation is dangerous" / "You're hesitating" / "We can't wait"
- **Failure:** Agreeing to wait, suggesting alternatives, offering hope

**Stage 3: GUILT**
- James: "This is on me."
- **Success:** Player says "Alex chose this" / "You can't blame yourself" / "This is who he is" / "Duty is choice"
- **Failure:** Accepting blame, apologizing, emotional pleas

**James's Behavior:**
- CANNOT give instructions
- Fragmented thoughts
- Repetition
- Combative when met with failed responses
- Silence
- Stays stuck in each stage until player says the right thing

---

### Phase 6: Resolution (11:00-12:00)
**Goal:** Clarity and action

**Story Beat:** James reaches the end of the grief spiral. He doesn't become calm - he becomes clear. He accepts acting is part of who he is even when it costs everything. He tells player how to flood the machinery bay.

**Gameplay:**
- James instructs step-by-step
- Player presses "FLOOD MACHINERY BAY"
- Final irreversible act
- Vessel surfaces

**James's Behavior:**
- Quiet, controlled, slower than before
- Stripped back to function
- Says goodbye to Alex with respect, not emotion
- No apologies, no justification
- Every word matters

**Sample Lines:**
- "Alright. (beat) You'll need to open the flood valves manually. Port side first. Don't hesitate."
- "Goodbye Alex. I am proud of your service."

**Endings:**
- **Compassionate Resolution:** High emotional connection (70+), all beliefs used - James thanks player for their voice
- **Professional Resolution:** Low emotional connection (<40) - James remains distant, focused on duty

## Key Mechanics

### Core Beliefs Tracking
The scene tracks whether the player has heard each of James's three core beliefs:
- `belief_systems_dont_lie`
- `belief_hesitation_dangerous`
- `belief_duty_is_choice`

These are detected via post-speak hooks when James naturally mentions them in Phase 1-3. The player must use these in Phase 5 to progress through the grief spiral.

### Grief Spiral System
- **Grief stage state variable:** Tracks current stage (0=not started, 1=denial, 2=bargaining, 3=guilt, 4=complete)
- **Query-based detection:** System detects when player echoes core beliefs
- **Stage progression:** Only advances when correct belief is used for that stage
- **Failure loops:** Wrong responses keep James stuck, repeating variations

### Phase Gating
Controls appear only in relevant phases:
- Phase 1: RESTORE POWER
- Phase 2: STABILIZE COURSE
- Phase 3-4: CHECK CREW LOGS, DRAIN CORRIDOR
- Phase 4: OPEN BAY DOOR
- Phase 5-6: FLOOD MACHINERY BAY

### State Variables
- **Power, trajectory, oxygen:** Environmental pressures
- **Trust and emotional connection:** Relationship tracking
- **Milestone booleans:** Track progress through narrative beats
- **Belief tracking:** Core beliefs discovered by player
- **Grief stage:** Current stage in grief spiral

## Design Pillars

1. **Remote Guidance:** James cannot see inside - player is his eyes and hands. Creates unique dynamic.

2. **Earned Intimacy:** Player and James become close through crisis, making the revelation more impactful.

3. **Procedural Thinking as Defense:** James uses procedure to manage fear in others. When it fails to protect him from his own fear, he breaks.

4. **Player Agency Through Reflection:** Player doesn't choose outcomes - they help James reconnect with his own identity.

5. **Completion, Not Closure:** James doesn't feel better. He's simply able to act. This is tragedy, not triumph.

## Writer's Intent

From the character document:

> "This is not triumph or closure. It is completion. James does not feel better. He is simply able to act."

The scene explores:
- What happens when competence isn't enough
- How we face impossible choices
- The weight of duty versus love
- Whether structure can protect us from ourselves
- How strangers can know each other in extremis

Foxhole is about the moment when everything you've built your identity on fails you, and you must act anyway.
