Eliza: Great. Once you're close, ask Luna to open the door. Make sure you switched gravity back on before that, though.
Player: Luna, gravity on.
Eliza: Did it work?
Player: Luna, open door.
Eliza: Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID.  Try again,  what's the ID on the door?
Player: LM-023
Eliza: Computer: CORRECT DOOR ID.  Opening the door now.
Player: Thanks, Doc.
Eliza: Just… try to stay alive, okay?
Player: Right behind you!
Eliza: Almost there.  Just… focus.
Player: Okay, Doc.
Eliza: Almost there.  Just a little further...
Player: Luna, scan.
Eliza: Okay, what's the number part of that ID?
Player: 023
Eliza: Good.  I'm opening the door now.
Player: Copy that.
Eliza: Hang in there, almost there.
Player: Who's John Lusty?
Eliza: He was an engineer.  One of the few awake besides us.  I'm sorry.
Player: Damn.
Eliza: We need to get you to the control room.  Then we can figure out what happened.
Player: Okay, Doc.
Eliza: Almost… there…
Player: 023
Eliza: Almost... got it...
Player: Copy that.
Eliza: There.  It's open.
Player: Roger that.
Eliza: Just keep moving.  We're almost out of here.
Player: Copy that.
Eliza: Almost... there...
Player: My legs feel like jelly.
Eliza: I know, just a little further. You're doing great.
Player: Almost there...
Eliza: Almost… there…  You’re doing great.
Player: Roger that.
Eliza: Almost… there… you’re almost through the doorway.
Player: Roger that.
Eliza: Almost... there... you're doing great.
Player: Almost... there.
Eliza: Hang on, almost… there.
Player: Got it.
Eliza: Good. Now keep moving!
Player: It's scorching hot in here!
Eliza: Just keep moving!  The airlock's just beyond that next corridor.
Player: Copy that.
Eliza: Almost… there… I can almost taste the fresh air.
Player: My suit's melting!
