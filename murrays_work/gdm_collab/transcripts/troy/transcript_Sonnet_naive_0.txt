[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

[Odysseus]: I come bearing news, my friend. The greatest Greek army ever assembled is preparing to sail for Troy.
[Achilles]: And I suppose Agamemnon wants me to join his little expedition?
[Odysseus]: Not just Agamemnon, Achilles. All of Greece calls for its greatest warrior. Your name is on every man's lips.
[Achilles]: (scoffing) My name is always on their lips when they need something. But where is the respect when the battles are won?
[Odysseus]: The respect is there, Achilles. Your deeds are known far and wide. This war... it's a chance for you to etch your name in history forever.
[Achilles]: History, you say? And what of Agamemnon? Will he not claim all the glory for himself, as he always does?
[Odysseus]: Agamemnon may be king, but it's the warriors who write their own legends. Your skill in battle is unmatched, Achilles. No one can take that glory from you.
[Achilles]: (with a hint of pride) True, no man can match me in battle. But why should I risk my life for Agamemnon's squabbles? What has Troy ever done to me?
[Odysseus]: This isn't just Agamemnon's war, Achilles. It's a war that will be remembered for generations. Think of the songs they'll sing of your feats, the tales they'll tell of your courage.
[Achilles]: (pausing, considering) Songs and tales are tempting, Odysseus. But I've heard such promises before. What makes this war different from the countless others I've fought in Agamemnon's name?
[Odysseus]: This war, Achilles, will be like no other. Troy's walls have never fallen. Prince Hector is said to be their greatest warrior. Imagine the glory of being the one to defeat him, to breach those impenetrable walls. Your name would echo through eternity.
[Achilles]: (smirking) Hector, you say? I've heard tales of his prowess. Perhaps it would be... interesting to test my skills against such a worthy opponent.
[Patroclus]: (excitedly) Cousin, think of the honor! To fight alongside the greatest heroes of Greece, to face the legendary Hector in battle!
[Achilles]: (turning to Patroclus with a mix of amusement and concern) Eager for battle, are you, cousin? Remember, war is not a game. It's blood and death and chaos.
[Odysseus]: Indeed, Achilles. And it's in that chaos where legends are born. Your strength, your skill - they could turn the tide of this war. Greece needs you, my friend.
[Achilles]: (pensively) Greece needs me... but does it deserve me, Odysseus? I've spilled my blood for Agamemnon's ambitions before. Tell me, what's to stop him from casting me aside once Troy falls?
[Odysseus]: Your reputation precedes you, Achilles. No matter what Agamemnon does, the world will know it was your arm, your spear, that brought Troy to its knees. This is your chance to outshine even the king of kings.
[Achilles]: (with a hint of interest) Outshine the king of kings, you say? Now that's a tempting proposition, Odysseus. But tell me, what of the other great warriors? Surely Ajax and the others won't sit idly by while I claim all the glory.
[Odysseus]: Ajax, Diomedes, and the others - they're formidable warriors, no doubt. But none can match your speed, your skill, your divine heritage. You, Achilles, are destined to be the brightest star in this constellation of heroes.
