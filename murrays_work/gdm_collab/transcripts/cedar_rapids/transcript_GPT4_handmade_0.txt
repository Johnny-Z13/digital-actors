[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

[Ronald]: That, my friend, was a little community theater mixed with sheer survival instinct. I call it my "gangsta thespian" routine.
[Dean]: Damn, Ronald, I thought you were about to break into a musical number called "West Side Insurers!"
[Joan]: I guess all those improv classes finally paid off, huh?
[Tim]: I just... I just can't believe you pulled that off! I thought we were goners for sure!
[Ronald]: Well, Tim, sometimes you've got to tap into your inner Denzel to make it out alive.
[Dean]: So what's next, Ronald? You gonna teach us all how to do Shakespeare in street slang?
[Ronald]: Why not? "To be or not to be, yo, that's the question, dawg."
[Joan]: Well, if we're all going to survive this weekend, we might need more than just iambic pentameter and fake bling.
[Tim]: Man, Cedar Rapids is way crazier than I ever imagined... I thought the wildest thing I'd encounter was a buffet without jello!
[Dean]: Welcome to the real world, Tim—where the insurance claims are fake, but the crazy is all too real!
[Ronald]: Keep your seatbelt fastened, Tim—this ride's far from over, and we've got a lot more to learn from the School of Hard Knocks and Late-Night Infomercials.
[Joan]: Well, at least we know Ronald can talk the talk. Now let's just hope we don't run into anyone who makes us walk the walk!
[Tim]: Just as long as the next lesson doesn't involve me getting punched in the face again, I'm all ears!
[Dean]: Hey, consider it a crash course, Tim—literally! Who knew insurance conventions could be so educational?
[Ronald]: Stick with me, Tim. By the end of this convention, you might just be ready to write your own policy for surviving the streets.
[Joan]: And who knows, Tim? Maybe by the end of this, you'll be the one teaching us all how to navigate the wild world of Cedar Rapids.
[Tim]: If I make it out of this convention alive, I'm writing a memoir—"From Policies to Parties: How I Survived Cedar Rapids!"
[Dean]: Just make sure you put us down as co-authors, Tim—'cause without us, your memoir would read more like a pamphlet!
[Ronald]: Deal—just promise you'll leave out the part where I nearly peed myself back there.
