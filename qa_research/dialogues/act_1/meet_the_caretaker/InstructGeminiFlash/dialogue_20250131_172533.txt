Eliza: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can hear me please repond!!!
Player: Yeah, I hear you.  I'm stuck in this… thing.  Frosted window, lights… feels like a really fancy coffin.
Eliza: Oh thank goodness! You're alive!  A stasis pod, you say?  Okay, hang tight, I'm going to try to get you out.
Player: Okay, I see "Emergency Override Activated" on the window.
Eliza: Good. Now, you should see a three-word passphrase displayed on the window.  Read it back to me, exactly as it appears.
Player: Bravo Tango Delta.
Eliza: Excellent!  Just one moment...
Player: Wait, is this thing actually opening?
Eliza: Almost there…  just a few more systems to reset.  How are you feeling?
Computer: CORRECT PASSPHRASE
