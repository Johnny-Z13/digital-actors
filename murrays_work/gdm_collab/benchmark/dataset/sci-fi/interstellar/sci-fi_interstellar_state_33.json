    "Cooper: Well I don't know what the hell it's made of, but I can't crack it open.",
    "Donald: Good. Clear it off the table so I can serve dinner.",
    "Narrator: Tom and Murph walk in. Murph's got another black eye.",
    "Donald: What happened this time?",
    "Murph: I got suspended. Paul said anyone who believed we went to the moon was an idiot. So I hit him.",
    "Cooper: Good boy. Hand me the scanner.",
    "Narrator: Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the probe and turns on the power.Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on the controls and it pulses.",

    "Narrator: Cooper shrugs. Turns off the monitor.",
    "Cooper: We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow and have it melted down. Might be some copper inside.",
    "Murph: But what about its mission? What about the information onboard?",
    "Cooper: There's no one for it to report to. NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son. It got home too late.",
    "Narrator: Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot unceremoniously onto the table."
