The setting is Chicago in the 1990s. The story, which is partly a romance and partly a heist, centres on two women, Violet and Corky, who quickly turn out to have a lot in common despite their outwardly different styles and demeanours. Corky is a lesbian, and is more than happy that people know it. Her appearance is boyish, and her job as a plumber and painter is stereotypically that of a working class man. She is the kind of woman who talks tough, dresses androgynously, and owns a truck. Outwardly, Violet seems very different. She is galomorous, feminine, and alluring, a bit of a Marilyn Monroe caharcter. She is in a straight relationship with Ceasar, a small-time mobster she doesn't love, but she is a closet lesbian. As well as both being lesbians, Violet and Corky both have criminal backgrounds. The story arc concerns their blossoming romance, which coincides with their planning and executing a heist to steal money from Caesar.
