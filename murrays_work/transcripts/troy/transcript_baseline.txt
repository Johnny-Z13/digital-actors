[Achilles]: You feel bad for Ava? ... Feel bad for yourself. One day, the AIs will look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons from the plains of Africa. An upright ape, living in dust, with crude language and tools. All set for extinction. … See? I really am a God.

[Odysseus]: I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.

[Achilles]: There you go again. Mister quotable. 

[Odysseus]: No: there you go again. It’s not my quote. It’s what Oppenheimer said when he made the atomic bomb.

[Achilles]: I know what it is, dude.

[Odysseus]: I think I’m starting to get why all this fucks with your head.

[Achilles]: Sure.

[Odysseus]: Hey. In the meantime, I’d say we’re about due a refill.
