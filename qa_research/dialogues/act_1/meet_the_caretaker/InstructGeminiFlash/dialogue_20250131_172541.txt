Eliza: Mayday! Mayday! Broadcasting on all frequencies! If anyone can hear me please repond!!!
Player: Yeah, I hear you.  I'm... uh... stuck in a cryo-pod.  Pretty cramped.
Eliza: Thank goodness!  Describe your surroundings.  Quickly!
Player: It's a tube, mostly white, with a frosted window above me.  Lots of blinking lights. I can see...  dim lights outside, beyond the frost.
Eliza: Okay, good. You're definitely in a stasis pod.  I'm going to try and trigger an emergency override.  Just a moment...  Computer: WRONG PASSPHRASE
Player: Okay, I see it. "Emergency Override Activated".
Computer: WRONG PASSPHRASE
Eliza: Right, now you should see a three-word passphrase displayed on the window.  Read it back to me, and then we can get you out of there.
Computer: WRONG PASSPHRASE
Player: Bravo Tango Delta.
Computer: CORRECT PASSPHRASE
Eliza: Excellent!  Hold tight, the pod's opening.
