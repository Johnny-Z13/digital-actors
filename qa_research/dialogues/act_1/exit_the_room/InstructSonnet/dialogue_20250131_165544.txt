Eliza: Great. Once you're close, ask Luna to open the door. Make sure you switched gravity back on before that, though.
Player: Luna, gravity on.
Eliza: Good thinking! Now, try asking Luna to open the door. Let me know if it works.
Player: Luna, open door.
Eliza: Did the door open? If not, I might have another way to get you through, but we'll need to be quick about it.
Player: No, the door didn't open. Luna said "Access Denied." What's your other way to get through?
Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID
Eliza: Alright, I've got a trick up my sleeve. I need you to scan the door and tell me its ID - it should be two letters followed by three numbers. Just the numbers will do. This isn't exactly protocol, but we're in crisis mode here.
Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID
Player: Luna, scan. The door ID is LM-023. So, the numbers are 023.
Computer: CORRECT DOOR ID
Eliza: Excellent! I'm bypassing the security protocols now. The door should be opening... There we go! You should be able to get through now. Let's keep moving - we need to find that control room as quickly as possible.
