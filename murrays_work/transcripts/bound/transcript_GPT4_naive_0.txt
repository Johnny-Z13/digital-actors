[Violet]: Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator ...

Corky: Corky. Yeah, I remember.
Violet: I brought you some coffee. Thought you might need it after working so hard.
Corky: Thanks. I can use it.
Violet: It's no problem. I was wondering if maybe you could help me with something.
Corky: What do you need help with?
Violet: There's a leak under my sink. I don't know anything about plumbing, and I thought maybe you could take a look?
Corky: Sure, I can take a look. Lead the way.
Violet: Great, thank you so much. It's just this way.
Corky: No problem. Let's see what we're dealing with.
Violet: I really appreciate it. It's been driving me crazy.
Corky: Don't worry about it. I'll have it fixed in no time.
Violet: You're a lifesaver, Corky.
Corky: Just doing my part.
Violet: I might have to find another way to thank you.
Corky: I'm sure we can think of something.
Violet: How about dinner tonight? My treat.
Corky: Sounds like a plan.
Violet: Perfect. I'll see you at seven.
Corky: I'll be there.
