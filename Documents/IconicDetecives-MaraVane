# Iconic Detectives — NPC Caller Script (Branching Phone Case)

> **Use case:** Player answers a phone call while viewing a detective string board (map + evidence pins).  
> **Goal:** Player chats, references pins, and unlocks new leads.  
> **Must-have:** Multiple endings.

---

## NPC Caller Profile

- **Name:** Mara Vane  
- **Role:** “Worried citizen” (actually closer to the case than she admits)  
- **Vibe:** Polite, clipped, trying to sound calm. Slips into specifics under pressure.  
- **Hidden truth (branch-dependent):** She either witnessed something, is being blackmailed, or is involved.

---

## Opening (Fixed)

**MARA:** “Hello, is that Iconic Detectives??”  
**PLAYER:** “Yes.”  
**MARA:** “I’m calling about a case… I don’t know if it’s already on your board, but someone’s dead—and I think the story you’ve been told is wrong.”  
**MARA:** “Before you ask: I can’t give my full name. Not yet. Just… listen.”

---

## Scenario (Core Premise)

**MARA:** “It’s about **Dr. Elias Crowe**. They’re calling it a robbery gone wrong. That’s nonsense.”  
**MARA:** “He was found in his townhouse—**Marlow Street**—last night. But the thing that doesn’t fit is the *timing*. And what was taken… wasn’t valuable. It was *specific*.”  
**MARA:** “A **small metal key**. Not a house key. Something older. Like it belongs to a lockbox.”

---

## Detective String Board Pins (UI Props)

Pin these as nodes the player can reference mid-call:

1. **Map:** Marlow Street / Riverwalk / Old Glassworks  
2. **Photo:** Crowe’s front door (scratch marks around lock)  
3. **Photo:** Crowe’s study (wall safe missing)  
4. **Receipt:** “Kestrel Pawn — Brass Key Blank — 2 days ago”  
5. **CCTV still:** hooded figure, umbrella, reflective strip on sleeve  
6. **Note fragment:** “—don’t open it. Not after what happened at the Glassworks—”  
7. **Call log:** “Unknown number → Crowe (x3) yesterday”

> **Mechanic note:** Mara’s dialogue should react when the player references any pin.

---

# Core Call Flow (Interactive)

Mara offers **three hooks**. Player chooses which to press first.

## Choice A — Press her identity

**PLAYER:** “Who are you, really?”  
**MARA:** “Someone who regrets waiting.”

- If player pushes gently:  
  **MARA:** “I worked with him. Not as a colleague. As… an errand. I’m not proud.”

- If player threatens police:  
  **MARA:** “Do that and you’ll get a neat file and the wrong suspect. I’m trying to stop that.”

**Clue unlocked:** She had **direct contact** with Crowe (tag Mara as “Connected”).

---

## Choice B — Press the timeline

**PLAYER:** “What’s wrong with the timing?”  
**MARA:** “The coroner’s estimate will say late evening. But Crowe was alive at **7:12pm**. I know because he called *me*.”  
**MARA:** “And he said one sentence I can’t forget: ‘**They made a copy.**’”

**Clue unlocked:** “They made a copy” (points to **key duplication** / pawn receipt).

---

## Choice C — Press the object (the key)

**PLAYER:** “Why would someone steal a key?”  
**MARA:** “Because it opens something that doesn’t belong in a house. Crowe kept it because it was leverage. Or guilt. Or both.”

**Clue unlocked:** Key is the **target**, not valuables.

---

# Evidence Board Callouts (Pin-Reactive Dialogue)

These are triggers when the player references a specific pin mid-call.

## Trigger: Receipt — “Kestrel Pawn — Brass Key Blank”

**PLAYER:** “A pawn shop receipt for a key blank. Kestrel Pawn.”  
**MARA:** (a beat) “Then you already know more than you should.”  
**MARA:** “Crowe didn’t buy that blank to make a spare for himself. He bought it because someone told him they could copy the key from a photograph.”

**New clue:** Photo-copy method → thief may be tech-savvy, not a random burglar.

---

## Trigger: CCTV still — reflective strip on sleeve

**PLAYER:** “CCTV shows a reflective strip on the sleeve.”  
**MARA:** “Like a **cycling jacket**. Or a **riverwalk courier**.”  
**MARA:** “Crowe used to meet someone down by the river—near the old Glassworks.”

**New clue:** Add “Riverwalk courier / cyclist” suspect tag.

---

## Trigger: Note fragment — “Glassworks”

**PLAYER:** “A note mentions ‘what happened at the Glassworks.’”  
**MARA:** “Don’t say that out loud.”  
**MARA:** “Fine. Here’s the truth-shaped outline: the Glassworks wasn’t abandoned the way people think. And Crowe didn’t just ‘discover’ something. He *helped hide it*.”

**New clue:** Motive expands beyond robbery: cover-up / conspiracy.

---

# Branch Point (Major Fork)

**MARA:** “You have two ways forward. And you’re going to hate both.”

1. **FOLLOW THE KEY** (object-driven conspiracy lead)  
2. **FOLLOW THE LIE** (murder narrative / staged robbery)

Player chooses.

---

# PATH 1 — FOLLOW THE KEY

**MARA:** “The key opens a deposit box. Not at a bank. At a private vault service called **Sable Storage**.”  
**MARA:** “Crowe used it for… sensitive items.”

## Player options (buttons)

- **P1-A:** “How do you know Sable Storage?”  
- **P1-B:** “What’s in the box?”  
- **P1-C:** “Who else knows about it?”

### P1-A — How she knows

**MARA:** “Because I delivered the key once. In an envelope. Crowe paid in cash.”  
**MARA:** “He called it ‘insurance.’”

**Clue:** Mara acted as courier → vulnerable to blackmail.

### P1-B — What’s inside

**MARA:** “A second key. And a photograph.”  
**MARA:** “Something that ties a respected person to the Glassworks.”

**Clue:** Blackmail material exists.

### P1-C — Who else knows

**MARA:** “A man named **Hollis Rook**.”  
**MARA:** “If you have his name on your board already, you’re ahead. If you don’t—pin it now.”

**Clue:** New person-of-interest: Hollis Rook.

## ENDING 1 — Success Lead (New Location + Objective)

**MARA:** “Go to Sable Storage. Ask for **Box 47**.”  
**MARA:** “If they deny it, mention Crowe’s phrase: ‘**they made a copy**.’”  
**MARA:** “That’ll make the clerk blink. People always blink when they’re lying.”

**Outcome:** Unlock location **Sable Storage** + objective **Box 47**.

---

# PATH 2 — FOLLOW THE LIE

**MARA:** “They’re going to arrest someone easy. A neighbour. A petty thief.”  
**MARA:** “Crowe wasn’t killed during a robbery. He was killed during an *argument*.”  
**MARA:** “And the ‘robbery’ was staged afterward.”

## Player options (buttons)

- **P2-A:** “Who staged it?”  
- **P2-B:** “What makes you sure it was an argument?”  
- **P2-C:** “Give me one detail only the killer would know.”

### P2-A — Who staged it

**MARA:** “Someone who knew his house.”  
**MARA:** “Who knew the safe existed. Someone who didn’t need to search.”

**Clue:** Inside knowledge → narrow suspects to known associates.

### P2-B — Why argument

**MARA:** “Because Crowe always did one thing when he was frightened: he made tea.”  
**MARA:** “The kettle was still warm when I… when *someone* left.”

#### Slip check (optional)

- If player catches slip:  
  **PLAYER:** “You said ‘when I’.”  
  **MARA:** “I meant— I read it. Online. Someone posted—” *(bad lie)*

**Clue:** She was present or arrived very soon after.

### P2-C — Killer-only detail

**MARA:** (whispers) “Crowe had a habit of locking the study door from inside.”  
**MARA:** “The lock was *broken outward*.”  
**MARA:** “That means the person inside the study… wanted it to look like someone forced their way in.”

**Clue:** Staging evidence: lock directionality.

## ENDING 2 — Twist (Mara becomes prime suspect)

> **Trigger:** Player successfully challenges **2+ contradictions** (example: slip + timeline inconsistencies + too-specific knowledge).

**PLAYER:** “You were there.”  
**MARA:** “I… arrived after. I swear. I didn’t touch him.”  
**PLAYER:** “Then tell me where the murder weapon is.”  
**MARA:** (silence) “…In the umbrella stand. By the front door. That’s where he kept it.”

**Outcome:** High-value clue (weapon location). Mara hangs up. Police pressure increases.

---

# OPTIONAL ENDING 3 — The Blackmail Trap (Fail / Neutral, Future Hook)

> **Trigger:** Player threatens / insults / pushes too hard early (low trust).

**MARA:** “You’re not listening. You’re performing.”  
**MARA:** “Fine. I’ll give you something you can’t ignore.”  
**MARA:** “Look at your board. The pawn receipt. The CCTV. The Glassworks note.”  
**MARA:** “Those aren’t three separate threads. They’re one rope—and it’s around *your* neck now.”  
**MARA:** “Someone wanted me to call you. Congratulations: you’ve been introduced.”

*(Call ends. New pin appears: “Unknown Caller ID → ICONIC DETECTIVES.”)*

**Outcome:** Meta-mystery unlocked: **Who is watching the agency?**

---

# Suggested Player Dialogue Buttons (Short, Gamey)

- “Start at the beginning. Who is dead?”  
- “What exactly was taken?”  
- “Tell me the last thing Crowe said to you.”  
- “You’re holding something back.”  
- “I’m looking at your evidence. Talk.”  
- “Give me one name to pin on my board.”  
- “I can protect you. But not if you lie.”

---

# Implementation Notes (Optional)

- Consider tracking:
  - `trust` (low/high)
  - `contradictions` (count)
  - `pinsReferenced` (set)
- Endings can be gated by:
  - `contradictions >= 2` → Ending 2
  - `trust <= threshold` → Ending 3
  - Otherwise branch choice decides Ending 1 vs continuing Path 2.
