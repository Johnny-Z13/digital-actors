[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

Ronald: We just went full-on 'action movie' back there.
Tim: I mean, how did you even pull that off, Ronald?
Ronald: Honestly, I just remembered what Omar would do and went with it.
Tim: Dude, you were like, channeling him or something. That was insane!
Dean: I still can't believe it worked. I thought we were done for back there.
Joan: Well, thank God for Ronald's improv skills. That saved our asses.
Tim: Ronald, you seriously need to teach me how to do that.
Ronald: Sure thing, Tim. First lesson: always look like you know what you're doing, even if you're terrified inside.
Tim: Got it. Fake it till you make it, right?
Dean: Just don't try it with everything, Tim. It doesn't always work out as planned.
Tim: Yeah, but it's better than freezing up completely.
Joan: At least we know we can count on each other when things get crazy.
Dean: Yeah, but let's hope it doesn't get that crazy again anytime soon.
Tim: Agreed. I don't think my heart can take another night like this.
Joan: We definitely need to come up with a better plan for next time.
Ronald: Next time, let's make sure we're not outnumbered and outgunned first.
Tim: Yeah, good call. Maybe we should stick to safer adventures for a while.
Dean: Safer adventures? With our luck, even a trip to the grocery store could turn into a fiasco.
Tim: True, but at least we'll be prepared with Ronald's badass training.
