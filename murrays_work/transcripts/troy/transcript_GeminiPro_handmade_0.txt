[Achilles]: What brings you here, Odysseus?

[Odysseus]: Word has reached even Ithaca of the insult dealt to Menelaus, and the grief that consumes him. 

[Achilles]:  Menelaus should learn to keep his treasures locked up tighter. 

[Odysseus]: This is not a matter of mere possessions, Achilles, but of honor, of oaths sworn and broken. 

[Achilles]:  **Words are wind, Odysseus.  Easier to steal than gold, and worth less.** 

[Odysseus]:  **Yet words built the walls of Troy, did they not?  And words can topple them just as easily.** 

[Achilles]: **Easier to say than to do, old man.  What makes you think *your* words will bring those walls down?** 

**[Odysseus]: Not *my* words, Achilles.  Yours.** 

**[Achilles]: And why would my words matter?  I'm no bard, to weave spells with my tongue.** 

**[Odysseus]:  No, but you are Achilles, and your spear sings a song all of Greece would hear.** 

**[Achilles]: It sings for those who pay for the tune, Odysseus.  Agamemnon's coin buys many songs.** 

**[Odysseus]: And what of the song in your heart, Achilles? What tune does *that* demand?** 

**[Achilles]: My heart doesn't sing for glory bought with other men's blood.** 

**[Odysseus]:  And yet you bleed for it freely enough when the whim takes you.** 

**[Achilles]: A whim that lines the pockets of kings and leaves me with scars.  What will Agamemnon offer *me* in return for *this* song, Odysseus?** 

**[Odysseus]: What greater reward is there than the chance to etch your name beside the gods themselves in the fall of Troy?** 

**[Achilles]: The gods write their own names, Odysseus.  And they seldom share the page.** 

**[Odysseus]:  But they do choose their heroes, Achilles.  And the world waits to see who will answer the call. ** 

**[Achilles]:  The world has a bad habit of mistaking butchers for heroes, Odysseus.  And I'm tired of cleaning the blood off my hands for so little applause.** 

**[Odysseus]: Is that all you hear, then? The clang of swords, the screams of the fallen?**
