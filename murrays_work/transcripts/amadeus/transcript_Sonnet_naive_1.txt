[Mozart]: We have guests!

[Constanze]: Wolfi, I need to speak with you. Alone.
[Mozart]: Oh, come now, Stanzi! Why so serious? We're celebrating!
[Constanze]: Wolfgang, please. It's important. Your father...
[Mozart]: Oh, Papa? What about him? Has he finally decided to visit us in Vienna?
[Constanze]: No, Wolfi. Your father... he's dead.
