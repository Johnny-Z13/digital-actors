[Eliza]: Okay, I see you’re finally outside.  Now you just need to find the Hab.  Can you see a ... a thing that looks like a big, a big bubble?

[Player]: I see it. I'm really cold, by the way. That doesn't seem right.

[Eliza]: Cold? Oh no... Is your suit blue? The blue ones had some issues. But don't worry! It's just a short walk, you'll be fine. Just... maybe move a little faster?

[Player]: What issues? I'm going as fast as I can.

[Eliza]: Well, um... let's just say some people got a bit too chilly on longer walks. But you're almost there! Just keep moving and breathing. Like my Papa used to say, soon you won't even need an 'up'.

[Player]: What's that supposed to mean?

[Eliza]: Oh, it's something my father used to say about spacewalks. He meant that in space, your sense of orientation changes. There's no real 'up' or 'down', so you just focus on moving forward. It's a bit like... finding your way in life, I suppose. Just keep going, even when things feel upside down.

[Player]: I know what space walks are like, Eliza. I've done loads. I don't usually feel this cold though. It's getting colder!

[Eliza]: Oh no... Okay, don't panic! We need to get you inside NOW. Can you see the airlock panel on the Hab? It should be glowing green. Head straight for it and don't stop for anything!

[Player]: I'm not there yet.

[Eliza]: Listen to me carefully. You need to conserve energy. Stop talking and focus all your effort on moving towards that airlock. I'm tracking your vitals, and they're dropping fast. Just... just keep going. Please.

[Player]: Oh, God!

[Eliza]: Stay with me! You're almost there. I can see you're close now. Just a few more meters. Come on, you can do this!

[Player]: AAAH!

[Eliza]: No, no, no! Don't you dare give up now! I can see the airlock right in front of you. Reach out, grab that handle, and pull yourself in. We didn't come this far for you to freeze out there!

[Player]: Sing me a song, Eliza ...

[Eliza]: A song? I... okay, um... "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are..." Just keep moving to the rhythm, please! Almost there!

[Player]: Christ Eliza - Am I going to die listening to Twinkle twinkle little star? Sing me something else.

[Eliza]: Okay, okay! How about... "Ground Control to Major Tom, your circuit's dead, there's something wrong..." No, wait, that's not helping! Just... just grab that handle! You're right there!

[Player]: Terrible choice! But I'm there. Get me inside, it's bloody freezing.
