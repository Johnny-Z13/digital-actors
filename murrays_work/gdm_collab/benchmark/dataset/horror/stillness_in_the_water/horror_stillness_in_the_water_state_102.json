        "HOOPER: ...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.",
        "BRODY: What stinks so bad?",
        "HOOPER: Our friend, the shark.",
        "Narrator: They bend over the shape like 18th century graverobbers.",
        "HOOPER: We always had a summer place on the water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I figured I'd major in something I knew about. Oceanography, marine biology. It was that, or design racing yachts like my older brother. Hmmm. He we go. Up the old alimentary canal. Hold the light.",
        "Narrator: We hear a slurp and a squish as Hooper produces a big knifeand dips into the shark with a major incision.",
        "HOOPER: We open the abdominal cavity and check the digestive tract. Simple. (he attends to his work)",
        "Narrator: From his vantage point, Quint watches, unseen by the twomen.Brody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex,fascinated by the bizarre ritual.",
        "BRODY: What's that?",
        "HOOPER: Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!",
        "BRODY: What? What?!",
        "HOOPER: Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.",
        "BRODY: How can you tell?",
        "HOOPER: (showing it) Florida license plate.",
        "BRODY: He ate a car?",
        "HOOPER: (laughs) No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...",
        "Narrator: He kicks the remains around below camera.",
        "HOOPER: ...Nothing.",
        "BRODY: What do we do?",
        "HOOPER: If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.",
        "BRODY: Chum?",
        "HOOPER: Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him. (checks his watch) It's a good time, too. They're night feeders..."
