    "Cruz: Baker.  You got it solved?",
    "Narrator: And now we see her.  From the rear.  Slouched at her station.Looks like a skinny teenager in tousled tawny hair, rumpledoversized workshirt, vintage jeans.",
    "Cruz: Actually. Yeh.",
    "Narrator: Not a kid's voice. Throaty.  Music and whiskey and sex and effortless confidence.  Even the voice turns us on.",
    "Cruz: Glances at his watch. What took you so long, Gin?  I called 4:30 this morn...",
    "Narrator: And stops. Because she turns with a look that would freeze anyone to stone.",
    "Gin: I was with someone, all right?",
    "Narrator: Now we really see her. Delicate bones and features, slender body,radiating the power of a natural heart-stopping beauty.  Gin Gerbarker is 32, ethereal and feral at once.  Electric green eyes crackle with an intellect and a will that are not to be fucked with.",
    "Cruz: So?  This is work.",
    "Narrator: He is not kidding.  Stainless steel beneath the dapper.  They are a matched team.",
    "Gin: Hector, I hardly know the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?",
    "Narrator: And he smiles.  Maybe she's lying.  He likes her.",
    "Cruz: Look at those assholes...",
    "Narrator: He means the cops on live feed.",
    "Cruz: If the Vermeer were lying on that table, they'd toss their doughnuts on it.",
    "Gin: Yeh, well, they didn't insure it, so they don't have to solve this. To them it's a crime.  To us it's 24 mil, less re-insurance, which is...",
    "Cruz: (grim) Only thirty percent, Gin.",
    "Gin: Ouch.  Really?",
    "Cruz: Which is why you're on this. Soft and straight.  You're the best.  I need you.",
    "Gin: He came in through the window.",
    "Cruz: That's not possib...",
    "Gin: What's not possible is entry through the doors or the vents.  That would have triggered instant alarm.",
    "Cruz: The windows are wired, too.",
    "Gin: Only for trauma.  They used smart glass, where the sensors respond to violation of the panel's integrity.",
    "Narrator: He's listening.  He always does with her.",
    "Gin: I think he scaled the wall, popped the frame.  In one piece.",
    "Narrator: She sounds awfully positive.  Then again, she always does.",
    "Gin: Then, he only had to deal with heat and motion sensors.  They were on 60-second delay, so the owner wouldn't trigger the alarm just be walking arou...",
    "Cruz: The pane weighs 200 pounds, the building's 1100 feet high.",
    "Gin: This particular guy is the best. The best there ever was.",
    "Narrator: Almost as if she knows who.  Cruz shakes his head...",
    "Cruz: Popping the frame would trigger the alarm.",
    "Narrator: She smiles.  First time.  Even at one-tenth power, it is dazzling light.  She touches the panel before her...",
    "Cruz: I wrote a program and ran it, Dumbo.",
    "Narrator: The live feed is replaced by a red-outlined rotating three-dimensional DIAGRAM of the living room.  The alarm box glows green.One window pane glows lavender.  She touches the panel, and the window shatters, the alarm instantly emits a PIERCING SCREECH.Reset.  As he watches.  This time the window SLIDES AWAY int othin air.  No sound.  A stick figure appears, crawls through the opening, and the alarm begins the slow beep we heard last night. Cruz just stares.",
    "Gin: Here's how I figured it out...",
    "Narrator: Live feed replaces the diagram.  Our camera ZOOMS toward a VASE oflilies by the window.  All the flowers are tilted in one direction.Over the lip of the vase, away from the window.",
    "Gin: No one arranges flowers like that. It was the draft from the window.",
    "Narrator: He turns to her.",
    "Cruz: You said.  This particular guy.",
    "Narrator: Now she is beaming.  Excited.  And just above a whisper...",
    "Gin: Andrew MacDougal.",
    "Narrator: Delighted at his stupefied reaction.",
    "Cruz: Why not Houdini?  Or Pretty Boy Floyd?  Maybe Jesus Christ.",
    "Gin: Because they couldn't do it.",
    "Narrator: His slow smile.  This fucking kid.",
    "Cruz: He's been out of the business. For ten years.",
    "Gin: Maybe not.  No one ever proved, hell, even arrested him, for stealing anything.  But we all know he was numero ichiban for thirty years.  Why not forty?",
    "Narrator: She's serious.",
    "Cruz: Why?  Because of the Bozo switch? Guys have been copying his pack- rat signature for decades.  Maybe the thief wanted it to look like MacDougal.",
    "Narrator: She doesn't even answer.  Just touches her panel, and one of thedata screens BLOWS UP to huge size.  It is...",
    "Gin: A list of his private collection. Complete to three acquisitions last Thursday.",

    "Cruz: No Vermeer.  Nothing close.",
    "Gin: Don't be a putz.  This is his legitimate collection, which he buys.  Presentable for any search warrant surprise party.",
    "Narrator: Names keep rolling, Degas, Paul Klee.  Amazing.",
    "Gin: What he rips off, he fences.  And the money feeds his portfolio of investments, which are daring, savvy, and obscenely succesf...",
    "Cruz: Oh, I get it.  He has no interest in Vermeers, so that proves he stole one.  By that logic, he oughta be a suspect most of the time.",
    "Narrator: She shakes her head, sadly.",
    "Gin: You love to embarrass yourself.",
    "Narrator: Touches her panel.  The big screen now shows a grainy videotape of...",
    "Gin: The auction.  Where our client bought the painting...",

    "Narrator: The tape PANS five PAINTINGS on the block.  We recognize our Vermeer, the city of Delft, the canal, the bridge.  The view pulls back to include the crowd, and...",
    "Narrator: freezes. One tiny section is circled.  And blows up twenty feet.high, so blurry as to be unrecognizable. Then, snaps to amazing resolution.  The image of...",
    "Gin: Anyone we know?",
    "Narrator: ...Andrew MacDougal, perhaps 60, as charismatic and shamelessly virile a face as one can recall. Etched with character and worldly experience, lit by a twinkle behind the razor-keen gaze.  Tall,wide shoulders, massive hands.  This guy would be more fun to fuck than fight.  By a lot.",
    "Cruz: So he was there.",
    "Gin: Staking it out.  Why bid, when you can mark the buyer, and jack it within the month?",
    "Narrator: She leans way back in the molded chair. Lifts her long legs up onto the console.  They end in slender bare feet.  The toeswriggle.",
    "Gin: At this moment, he is winging on JAL flight 307 to Narita, ostensibly to attend a prestigious auction at the Hotel Akura, which will include a mixed media collage/oil by Georges Braques, on which he supposedly has his eye.",
    "Cruz: But you know better.",
    "Gin: Bet your ass.  At Vegas odds.",
    "Narrator: Touches the panel.  The big screen now holds three faces, three names.",
    "Gin: Research reveals three known fences, still at large, who are believed to have brokered Vermeers to black market buyers.  Sandrine Palmer is hospitalized in Malta with ovarian cancer.",
