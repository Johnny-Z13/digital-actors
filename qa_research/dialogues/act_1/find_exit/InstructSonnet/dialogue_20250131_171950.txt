Eliza: Schematics show there's a walkway leading up to an exit above you - get out of there!
Player: I don't see any walkway, Eliza. Everything's blocked by fire and debris. How am I supposed to get up there?
Eliza: Hmm, we'll have to think outside the box. I'm sending an unofficial upgrade to your eye-OS. Once it's installed, say "Luna, disable gravity." Trust me, it'll work.
Player: Alright, here goes nothing. Luna, disable gravity.
Eliza: Did it work? Are you floating? This is quite exciting, actually. I've never tried zero-gravity myself!
Player: Yeah, it worked! I'm floating up now. This is... incredible. Terrifying, but incredible. I can see the whole deck from up here, all the flames and destruction. It's like a nightmare, but I'm flying through it.
Eliza: I can only imagine how surreal that must feel. Stay focused on reaching that exit, though. We need to get you to safety. How close are you to the walkway now?
Player: I can see the walkway now. It's a long metal ramp, but it looks like it's collapsed in some places. I'm drifting towards it, but it's going to take a while to reach the exit. This zero-gravity thing is harder to control than I thought.
Eliza: Take your time and be careful. Remember, in zero-gravity, even small movements can propel you quite far. Try to use the walls or any stable structures to guide yourself. And don't worry, I'll be right here with you every step of the way. How are you feeling?
Player: I'm feeling a mix of awe and terror, Eliza. It's beautiful up here, seeing the curve of the ship, but the flames below are a constant reminder of the danger. I'm trying to stay calm, but my heart's racing. How do you handle high-stress situations like this?
Eliza: As a doctor, I've learned to compartmentalize in emergencies. Focus on the immediate task at hand - in your case, reaching that exit. But it's okay to feel overwhelmed; just remember to breathe. Deep breaths can help steady you, even in zero-gravity. Now, tell me what you see ahead. Any obstacles between you and the walkway?
Player: I see some debris floating around - broken panels and what looks like parts of droids. I'm trying to maneuver around them. The walkway's getting closer, but there's a large gap in it about halfway to the exit. Should I try to float over it or look for another way?
Eliza: Float over the gap if you can. It's risky, but with the gravity disabled, you should be able to clear it. Just make sure you have enough momentum. If you're not confident, look for something to push off from. Remember, every action has an equal and opposite reaction in space. How's your confidence level? We can work through this together.
Player: I'm feeling pretty confident, Eliza. I think I can make it over that gap. There's a large piece of debris nearby - I'm going to use it to push off and give myself some extra momentum. Here goes nothing!
Eliza: Excellent thinking! Use that momentum wisely. I'm on the edge of my seat here - let me know as soon as you've cleared that gap. And remember, if anything goes wrong, we can always reactivate gravity. You're doing great!
Player: I made it, Eliza! That push really did the trick. I'm past the gap now and floating towards the intact part of the walkway. The exit door is in sight. Should I reactivate gravity once I'm close enough, or keep floating until I reach it?
