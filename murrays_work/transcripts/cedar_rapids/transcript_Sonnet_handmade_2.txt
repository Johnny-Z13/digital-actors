[Tim]: What the fuck just happened?

[Ronald]: Yo, homies, we just bounced outta there like some straight-up G's, you feel me? That's how we do in the streets, son!
[Dean]: Holy shit, Ronald! Where the hell did that come from? You went from insurance salesman to Tupac in 0.2 seconds!
[Joan]: I don't know whether to be terrified or impressed. Ronald, you've been holding out on us!
[Tim]: I can't believe it! Ronald, you're like... a secret gangster insurance agent or something! Is this real life?
[Ronald]: Nah, man, it's all an act. Just tapped into my community theater days. Guess those improv classes finally paid off, huh?
[Dean]: Well, I'll be damned! Ronald, you've got more layers than a triple-decker policy! Next time we're at a sales pitch, I'm bringing you as my secret weapon!
[Joan]: Forget insurance sales, Ronald. You should be teaching a masterclass in "How to Bullshit Your Way Out of a Redneck Rumble 101"!
[Tim]: Guys, I think I'm gonna be sick... but also, can we do that again? Is this what being cool feels like?
[Dean]: Hold up, Timbo. Let's not confuse 'cool' with 'nearly getting our asses handed to us by a bunch of meth-heads'. But I gotta say, that was some next-level shit, Ronald. You just earned yourself a lifetime supply of whiskey on me!
