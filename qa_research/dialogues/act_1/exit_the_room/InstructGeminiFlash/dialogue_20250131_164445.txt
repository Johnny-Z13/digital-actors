Eliza: Great. Once you're close, ask Luna to open the door. Make sure you switched gravity back on before that, though.
Player: Luna, gravity on.
Eliza: So? Did the door open?
Player: Luna, open door.
Eliza: Computer: THIS IS NOT A DOOR ID.  Try again, but this time, scan the door ID and just give me the numbers.
Player: 023
Eliza: Computer: CORRECT DOOR ID.  Right, opening the door now.
Player: Thanks, Doc.
Eliza: Just... take it slow.  Things are still pretty unstable out there.
Player: Copy that.
Eliza: Almost there.  Just... try to avoid any more… spontaneous combustions.
Player: Roger that.
Eliza: And try not to burn down the whole ship before you reach the control room, alright?
Player: Will do.
Eliza: Good.  Let's get you to safety.
Player: Okay, Doc.
Eliza: Almost there, I can feel it.
Player: Going in.
Eliza: Just breathe. You're doing great.
Player: Whew.
Eliza: Almost there, I think... just a little further.
Player: It's awfully hot in here.
Eliza: Almost there... you're doing great.
Player: It smells like burnt toast.
Eliza: Almost... there... you're safe now.
Player: Thanks, Doc.
Eliza: Now, let's get you patched up.  Those burns don't look pretty.
Player: My suit's sensors are fried.
Eliza: I'm rerouting emergency power to the medbay.  It should be… mostly functional.
Player: It's a bit toasty in here.
Eliza: Good. Now, let's get you to the medbay.
Player: Copy that.
Eliza: Just keep moving.  The control room's just beyond that next door.
Player: Okay, Doc.
Eliza: And try to keep your wits about you.  Things are still very much…  *unpredictable*.
Player: Okay.
Eliza: Just remember, you're almost there.
Player: Luna, scan.
Eliza: Okay, what's the number sequence?
Player: 023
Eliza: Good.  Let's get you to the medbay.
Player: My suit's thermal regulation is completely shot.
Eliza: Hang in there, almost to the medbay.
Player: It's hotter than a supernova in here!
Eliza: Almost... there... just a little further...  I can see the medbay doors.
Player: Almost there.
Eliza: Almost… there… you’re safe.
Player: Man, I need a cold drink.
Eliza: And try to remember to breathe, okay?
Player: Okay, Doc.
