[Eliza]: Okay, I see you’re finally outside.  Now you just need to find the Hab.  Can you see a ... a thing that looks like a big, a big bubble?

[Player]: Yeah. I can see it.

[Eliza]: Um, cool. So, like, just head towards it. And, um, how are you feeling out there? My Papa used to say spacewalks were kinda... weird. Like, you're constantly falling, but not? Is it, like, freaking you out or anything?

[Player]: No, I'm fine. I've done it before in training. Not quite the same, but so far so good.

[Eliza]: Oh, that's good. Um, I've never actually done a spacewalk myself. It's kinda... scary, you know? Like, all that nothingness around you. Do you, um, find it beautiful out there? Or is it just... space?

[Player]: It's different from training, knowing it's real. Nothing between me and the void except this suit.

[Eliza]: Yeah, like, that's totally intense. Um, speaking of suits... is yours, like, blue by any chance? Just, um, asking for no particular reason or anything...

[Player]: Yeah, blue. My favourite colour.

[Eliza]: Oh, um, that's... great. Just, uh, maybe walk a little faster? Those blue suits sometimes have, like, temperature regulation issues. But don't worry! It's totally fine for short walks. Probably.

[Player]: What? Temperature issues!

[Eliza]: Um, yeah... but like, don't freak out or anything! It's just a tiny glitch, you know? Like, maybe move a bit quicker, but it's totes fine for short trips. You're almost there, right? Just keep going, and um, maybe think warm thoughts?

[Player]: I'm there. I'm at the Hab.
